Your everyday schedule is filled with wasteful meetings that could have been avoided with better organization and a few emails. Instead of addressing the fundamental issues, we waste more time in even more meetings looking for band-aid solutions.Routinely multiple teams get assigned with the same task. It is not unusual for a closed task to be redone because no one bothered to check whether it was already completed. And then we have meetings to discuss why we have multiple people doing the same thing. Followed by meetings to follow up on the meeting. And more meetings when it happens again. And again. And again.All the disorganization translate to constant scrambling around trying to meet deadlines, resulting in lacking work quality, which is evident from your first week of working at AMD.Expect to be involved in never-ending fire drills resulting in constant 60+ hour work weeks. There is no overtime pay, and zero appreciation or recognition of you wasting your entire weekend working on yet another fire drill.Connection buildingDisorganization, no work-life balance, lack of recognition, poor benefitsFast-paced, competitive environment (our biggest competition was Intel)It was a great place to work. I learned a lot about capital equipment and services procurement and about the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Strong, focused leadership.1Secure job, poor work life balance, unfair pay and promotion systemAn old giant organization with rigid process. Bureaucratic every where. You are promoted fast if you are the boss' favourite. If you are not your management's most favorite, they need you to perform 120% to be considered. Promotion system is ridiculous. Only 2 to 3 are promoted every year for a 30-people team.Pay is extremely unfair. I was lowballed when first hire because i needed a job at that time. Never got adjusted. They pay new hire 30% or even 40% more than I currently do.Work life balance not existed in many teams, especially those who are forced to work with geographic distributed teams. Almost every project involves Asian teams. Saying ""no"" to consistent evening calls is considered ""not performing"", not going above and beyond.Job is secure if the company is doing well. Still a choice to work flexible hours, like leaving work early for families/kids Flexibility on remote, depending on your managerEverything mentioned No gut in firing consistently non performing employeesVery supportive cultureI have worked at AMD for a year now. Everyone is very willing to help and provide support when needed. I feel like the work/life balance is well maintained and is an important aspect of the culture of the company. The onboarding process was easy and the resources and contacts provided to me set me up to quickly and easily learn my role so I could be independent and knowledgeable within the first month. I was assigned an amazing trainer who was very compassionate and made me feel confident and knowledgeable fast within my new role so that I could be independent quickly.Gifts given to team to celebrate wins, great culture and sense of being able to be yourself.None at the moment12Stimulating environment, great culture, but some frustrations and crunch.ProsYou'll be working with and making meaningful contributions towards getting cutting edge technology into the market. The culture is collaborative and some of your coworkers are leaders in their area. Lots of opportunity to learn and grow while building cool stuff.ConsSchedules can be pretty aggressive, and resourcing tends to be lean. Unfortunately, past crunch or missed deadlines don't always lead to institutional learning for the next project, which can be frustrating.Advice to ManagementTreat any late-caught issue or schedule near-miss as a planning failure. Invest in unit-level tests as early in development as possible for every features failing late in development. You will save people from getting pulled into emergencies, improve morale, shorten development schedules, and save cost on man-hours to deliver a project.toxic culture at the finance/accounting departmentlong hours and stressful work environment,no work-life balance,toxic culture from the top management (in finance org),high turn over rate,compensation is lower than the marketAMD is a cool company, stock is going upno work-life balance, no stock/little bit stocks for finance peopleGreat Place to WorkGreat experience working at AMD. Diverse work place, management is willing to work with you if you want to move up and advance your career. They take care of their employees.Work environment, diverse.1No work life balanceThe company may be doing good from outside, but employees are taking the hit. Work life balance is non-existent, with majority of the employees working 60 to 80 hours a week, even during the weekend. The management is still unappreciative of the effort and expects the engineers to push harder.3Fun workplace with lots of smart peopleWorked in the Server Validation team in the summer. Everyone is extremely smart and passionate about their work. Not much interaction though due to working remotely during covid.Insurance Plans, Lots of Paid Vacation, Good PayNot much collaborationA typical hi-tech companyThe work process is flexible without standardized flow to follow. Senior management doe not help much. Workplace culture is driven by the front line manager.Good work/life balance. Interesting work.Interesting work but pay can be more. There is no lunch. There is table tennis and gym on site. Campus is small and 45 minutes to Boston. Job requirements are satisfying and encouraging. Management is nice and understands employees.No lunch1Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team cultureManagement's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself.

Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5).2Outdated ProcessesThe company is in a great place from the outside looking in, but employees are often overworked and low morale is rampant. Late night calls happen often and are expected, so work/life balance is non-existent.1Productive and fun workplaceGood company to work with very supportive and provide good work life balance, quality of work is very good, work from home facilities are provided as well.good place to workGood place to work. A lot of learning opportunities. Hours were flexible. I was just a contractor so I am not eligible for benefits but heard that benefits are good.Terrible culture, Chaotic environemnt, horrible middle managementGood:- Base pay above industry average.- Decent benefits- Coworkers are good.Bad:- Management cannot be trusted.- Finger pointing culture.- Status quo cannot be challenged.- Toxic work environment, raised to HR nothing happened. Was told to suck it up and focus on work.- Broken tools, new issues pop up at the moment you least expect.- No processes & structure, fire fighting everyday.- Global Operation is treated as cost center, no manager (including VP & SVP) dare to challenge their counterpart in Business Unit.- Tribal knowledge & silo mentality. Left hand do not talk to right hand.- Poor work life balance, most people work 50~60 hrs every week.Base pay above industry average.Toxic work cultureCompetent leadership, lots of great learning opportunities, and room to grow.AMD is finally out of the shadows of the other x86 company and leading the industry. It is also doing well in the GPU market. Employees are motivated and among the best in the industry. The compensation could be better, but this is probably true for all non-FAANG companies. Good work-life balance, good quality of work, and still the attitude of a hungry underdog.Quality of workCompensationGreat place to learn - Difficult to maintain work-life balanceLoved the work and the people at AMD. Lots of opportunity to learn and be challenged. Supportive managers. The volume of work made it difficult to successfully manage work and home life.A management supported balance between what needed to be done and self-directed projects to studyIt was very common for management to allow for 20% of workhours to go toward self-directed areas of interest. You found something interested and you were encouraged to draft a project plan, including budget, to study that interest, at least as the yield improvement manager for semi-production, that's how I treated my people.Career advancing interests supportedIt's a factory so many repetitive tasks required to keep the product moving, and to improve the process was always a pressure on time.Work like balanceWork life balance is good, career development opportunities , i get to work on while i like and never feel burdened , teammates are always helpful and there is healthy competitionWork life balancestock optionsHighly disorganizedThis company is always one step ahead of dying There is little guidance and there was zero development There also seems to be little that management does to implement any learning it gets from employeesPaycheckZero cultureBeautiful work environment, good work-life balance, so-so senior leadershipIn general, AMD is a big computer hardware company permeated with an overwhelmingly sense of ""hero worship"" of senior management during my time there. My immediate manager was nurturing and helped me advanced to the next level of my career progression.My coworkers were smart, easy-going and fun people you want to hang out with after work. Advice to senior leadership: Hire great leaders, not good people. Leaders that are forward-looking with great vision, not tunnel vision that don't miss out on opportunities (i.e. tablet industry).Free coffee and tea, fun coworkers, beautiful work environmentOver-worship of senior management, tunnel vision of leadershipGreat place to workPay is very good and paid time off is very generous. Informal work environment especially with working from home due to covid. But this company is a total market leader.Fast pace and interesting technologies with some caveatsAMD has great technology, a lot of smart engineers, interesting area to work in technicality. If that was the entire view of a company, then I would have given it 5 stars. The issues at AMD has more to do with its compensation and reward culture than on the technical front. Management don't hire enough competent engineers who are doing the actual work, instead, they hire ""senior"" members that actually don't do the day to day work. You are not rewarded based on the amount of work you do or the quality of work you do, instead you get rewarded for ""politics"". There are some great engineers but they are often not rewarded for their work vs mediocre senior engineers that don't do anything other than code reviews or filing jira tickets.Work-life balance: Due to lack of management, any issue becomes a priority one issue and you're expected it solve it yesterday. As a result, ""unexpected"" work on weekends happen quite often.It's hard to say about compensation since the stock has gone so well in the past few years but it remains to be seen if AMD will be able to sustain it. But don't expect tier one general compensation.I actually like the CEO, she has saved AMD from the abyss of 2012/2013. The direction and technical work is definitely interesting if you put in the time to learn and in large part is due to her leadership to shift the focus of AMD into areas and beating Intel at the same time.Great and interesting technology.Promotion culture and bad management with engineers.challenging, fast paced work environmentworked in the labs for over 20yrs.. the environment is a mix of good+bad.the good: cutting edge equipment and tech. never boring. constant learning curve and opportunities to problem solve. you never know what is waiting for you when you come inthe bad: very stressful. poor support and training. did i say stressful? high pressure work environment. everything needed done last month.people and benefits. never boring.too stressful.Great Place to workA typical day as an engineer will be switching between tasks and priorities. Less is more is the philosophy and management makes the employees feel critical in driving AMD goals. Highly invested employees who live and breathe AMD. Co-workers become like family and friends and being understaffed compared to bigger peers, working smart is rewarded. Lots of long hours but never saw anyone complaining as AMDers know how to make work fun.Workplace culture, knowledge base, growth opportunitieswork-life balanceProductive place with ping pong tableA typical day at work starts at 830 and ends at 530.Learn to do programming and testing.Culture is decentHardest part of the job is learning on your ownConsole GamingStressfulGood company with not-so-good middle managersAMD in itself is a good company with great products and a great CEO. However, my experience as an engineer was not so great. The main problem lies with middle management. Unfortunately, my manager had no regard or interest in my professional growth -- he wouldn't provide any meaningful feedback on my performance even after multiple requests, no one-on-one meetings, kept me working on the same things for 6 years with no scope of learning anything new even though I kept on requesting, minimal raise and absolutely no recognition. Favoritism and politics are rampant. People are generally nice on the surface, but cold. I felt like a cog in the wheel and ultimately ended up leaving the company (or more correctly, my manager).On the plus side, benefits are good and the pay is okay. The company has been doing well and is under capable leadership. The work environment isn't bad in general and quite often HR would host fun events and stuff. While work-life balance isn't that great, I have had far worse experiences. However, AMD works on cutting edge technology and products, so while there is potentially opportunity to learn new and interesting things, almost all tasks are very partitioned and made limited in their scope. I guess that's kind of the nature of a big and mature company, but chances are that one will probably end up getting assigned a small part of the design and not learn a whole lot. Overall, it's not a bad place to work at, as long as you are lucky enough to get a manager who actually cares.Interesting technology, good benefits, good leadershipBad middle managementNiceEverything is great about work.and things go so well and everything get completed on time. This job is seasonal but still goes great. There is lots of people here. We get alone well.MoreLess moneyGood companyGreat team to work withGreat products to sellGreat technology to developSuper friendly cultureSupportive managementGood equity valueBenefits can be improvedGood experienceHad fun at my job learned how to use the walkie talkies and learned 10/4 lol it was a good work experience i had to put on my resume the only hardest job was just remember all the codes lolDefinitely the workplace cultureI enjoyed working with my colleagues and creating special that we could be proud to say we made that. The opportunity to learn and grow with them was an experience i would not trade for anything.Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team cultureManagement's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself. Multiple new products overlapping for product development resources and poor planning for much needed production equipment resulted in engineers working long days, late nights, weekends, holidays far too often. Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5).2Great place to workI loved working at AMD. It’s a great company filled with great people! It takes allot of organization l, communication and time management skills. Things can change and so can your job very quickly so you have to get to know the internal structure and find a place where you fit.Great people, but all are spread way to thin.Work ethic and skills of team members is among the best in the high tech industry. Lots of frustration throughout the organization due to insufficient staffing and resourcing of projects.Dedication to Community Service & Producing Great ProductsAMD prides itself on a diverse culture and it's commitment to the community and making great products responsibly. I am proud to work for a company lead by an amazing woman and dedicated engineers. It is a team environment and everyone's voices are heard. The company values your input and uses employee feedback to continue to grow and improve.Great opportunities ... and challenging managementThe company is small when compared to its primary competitors ... therefore, I find that there are many opportunities to take on challenging and fun tasks. However, many of the middle management are focused on maintaining their status rather than driving innovation.AmdMost of the people at AMD are very talented and have desire and willingness to do a great job. The overall culture of management in the company is not ""do it right""...it is ""do it right now""....Consequently, problems STAY problems...they don't get FIXED, they get 'patched'...time and time and time again...Substantially over worked and understaffed...hopefully, it will change someday....but, it has not changed, yet....Scrappy culture - underdog competing with giantsLacks consistent corporate culture - your experience varies widely depending on your manager/org. But there are many great people there and they definitely are good at innovating.Great company to work forSpent 7 years with AMD. a roller-coaster for sure but overall a lot of fun and great experiences.. I would recommend anyone to interview and work here.Great place to work due to peersYou are given great liberty to do your work as you see best. Great teammates within the SLT realm. Very supportive, respectful, and fun environment.Best places to workI worked as a market research intern and enjoyed everyday till my last day here. My boss was great, she was friendly and guided me properly during my induction phase. Work and office culture is also great.EverythingAMD has a fun and relaxing atmosphere and most of all a great work/life balance.Great place to work at. The work/life balance is such a plus and the opportunity to think out of the box and take of the blinders is an awesome touch.smart engineersgreat place to be around innovative engineeringthe people are pleasant and communicativeexciting technologygood leadershiprelaxing atmospheregood benefitsA lethal combination of micromanagement and lack of processesLack of investment in foundational financial systems leading to manual and inconsistent financial reporting processes that are not repeatable or scalable with growth. No interest in original ideas from outside talent, which leads to micromanagement. That tone is set from the top.Paying low and less diversity of productsAMD is paying employee pretty low, and the stock compensation is very low. When I was in AMD, AMD is not doing very well, so the working experience is not very good to me. But, overall, this company is very good at management and motivating people.Gave me a chance at advancement: from Materials Analyst to Business AnalystVery nice staff; I wasn't fond of my job on a daily basis. I would have liked more investigation within the job. I didn't think they paid well when I first started. Was told later you either get the ""Money"" as you come into the company or you don't get it. This was by another employee - may be way off base?Micromanagers, promote isolationMicromanagers, promote isolation, a dont care attitude for the individual. Had to reverse engineer almost everything to come up to speed, and complete goal..Great place to learn a lot fast.Can be a bit hectic at first, the fast pace will continue even after the understanding settles in. The campus in Austin has a lot of nice features such as gym and cafeteria.Good companyCan be stressful depending on who runs the project but all in all a good place to work. Location and campus is overall a nice place. Good benefits and good people.AMD is a great place to learn and work with remarkable engineersAMD has been around a long time and a nearly all innovators in the silicon industry have spent some time at AMD. AMD’s engineering innovation is fantastic, while the company has occasionally suffered with management missteps. Currently the company is doing very well, but Intel is a very hard company to compete against so be realistic about your planning.Very good company to develop and learn fromAMD’s long history has produced hard-to-change negative culture in some areasLots of volatility when I was there.Short staffed and lots of turnover, due to people moving on or due to layoffs and reorganization. I left before it was profitable so I think it's better now. I did like the organization because there were a lot of great people.Good place to workAMD is a good place to work. The company has made an impressive improvement in both, the market (its market share) and advancements in technologies. It is by far one of the most successful stories in the past 3 years.Great work/life balance, lots of freedom, and great compensationNo advancement opportunities. Lots of ""politics""."
Stellantis,"Avoid!!!This company doesn't care about their people, we're just a number. They did great during covid by keeping us on and still paying us and our bonuses.

Unless you love being treated like scum than I wouldn't recommend this dumpster fire of an automaker. Consistent restructuring has left many laid off and out of work due to the companies lack of intelligence at the top.Very non productive u r just a numberIt’s quantity not quality all they care about are numbers no work/life balance basically u live there enough time off to sleep if you are a tpt u are treated like dirtNoneLies upon lies especially from the union pay union dues and no union benefitsStressful and racistThe environment is very stressful and the management is very unprofessional! The Team Leads are lazy and and inconsiderate. Depending on your race determines how much leverage you have. The rules change weekly without notice and there are too many unnecessary meetings that last over an hour while still having to complete your tasks before your shift ends.You will get hired.You won’t last long.Great benefitsBest benefits.... This alone makes it a great place to work. Health care is covered completely and it doesn't come out of your check. And they offer midnight shift, which is ideal for meTpts get all the hard and possible assignments. A TPT makes $15 an hour while Jeep employees make 32 and watch the tpt's do all the work.Honestly it's the hardest job I've ever done. No respect no encouragement and no possibility of advancement. Jeep hasn't hired full-time employees and almost 5 years.It is a jobBasically has the TPT you are a floor matGood pay but its the auto industryMoney can't be beat but they wont hesitate to lay you off or send you across the country permanently. Its ultimately not worth it for most people myself included.MannI’m a se/tpt. They treat se/tpt like a stepchild. I would let my enemy work here. It seems like the only thing good about Jeep is their benefits. They the only thing that’s keeping folks there. They give .88 cent raise every year until hit the maximum of getting paid there. Apply if you want to. You’ll be waiting for years to get hired there.Challenging Place To WorkEncountered opportunities for diverse roles and work experiences. Work/life balance was difficult to maintain. Business processes and strategies changed often, along with management. Internal networking and mentoring are crucial for advancement.Good Pay, Boring workIf your after only the money this place is for you. I worked there for 11 years and while I am truly blessed to see that amount of money, I felt that super bored and disposableGood pay everything else is subjectiveThey want you to work 6 days 10 hours. New hires come in as temps and usually stay that way for about 4 years. Union isn’t really good. Other than that is just a job. Not the worst not the best. Very time consuming and will have you away from your family a lot.Good pay/benefits, no work life balanceBusy, demanding, good pay and benefits. All the overtime you want. No work life balance, demanding upper management, an hourly workforce that suck and lower management stuck fighting both. Stressful and not very rewarding.The same as any other environmentWork is what you allow it to be. True, this line of work can be very demanding and stressful, definitely time consuming. However, if you do what is required of you and not allow the foolishness to invade your space you will be just fine. Learn to control what you can control.Compensation, insurance benefits, company car program.Long work hours, 6/7 days a week of working.Avoid!!!This company doesn't care about their people, we're just a number.

Fast paced and a lot of great people to work with. Working with operators, material, Quality and IE helped the days go by fast.Good working environment bad managementThe people are nice but I can't say I am on board with most of their decisions. The management needs to be less authoritarian. Career growth and salary raise are completely luck based.Great pay and benefitsGreat pay and benefits. Lots of mandatory overtime. No work life balance. Lots of easy jobs but also lots of hard jobs. Long time until you are full time and get all the benefits, start out as a supplemental employee and stay that way for about 3 or 4 years.Horrible working conditions. Do not hire on here.I’m a TPT (all employees start off this way) and I started back in April. I have never seen such horrid working conditions in my entire life.Since i started I have worked:12 hour shifts (everyday)6 days a week (7 days fairly often)I almost lost my job due to having to go to a funeral for my grandmother.They do not care about you, your schedule, your life.Sooner or later someone’s going to be driven to take they’re own life in these conditions….Huge high-schoolWhile the supplemental employees run the facility, we are treated like red head step children you can go the extra mile and learn all the jobs they won't pay you no different and they expect high volume out you everyday they want you on the line 15 mins before it starts that you're not paid for, after that they expect you not to leave the line early this place is a jokeGood Pay for Unskilled Labor, Ultimately not worth it.The pay is decent when you top out as an unskilled worker. Other than that, managements goal is to fire you and very long hours and hard work leaving no time or energy for a personal life. Stay away.Pay (after 8 years), BenefitsManagement, Hours, Work, flexability, Culture.ProductiveI love it and it pays well. A little hot in the summer and long ten hour shifts but the benefits are great. Lots of Vacay time and Union shop is cool.Starting as a Temp means low pay/long hoursI started as a temp and was told over and over that we would be ""rolled over"" and actually hired by the company, in the mean time, I was required to work 6 days per week most weeks, when they went on a layoff, there was no work available so there was no pay. Job culture sucks because no one cares about the temps.Some jobs are extremely easyEverything elseAs a temp you have no job security.Great money but as a temp you don't know from one day to the next if you will have a job. They bring people from areas out of the labor market to fill full time positions and you can expect to be a temp for years.Great place to work that also provides great wagesI work at one of the Stellantis plants in Detroit Michigan and I have been here for over 10 years. The pay is great the schedule could be a little bit more flexible but the compensation that you receive is great.They ask you to do work but provide no trainingFor a company this big you think they would provide some in house training and support but they do not they expect you to learn it on your owen and then question why you are not able to get anything doneExtremely negative work environment with zero regard towards proper work/life balance.Extremely negative work environment. Zero regard towards proper work/life balance. The tools and resources needed to complete daily job duties are not readily available. System software and equipment do not function properly on a consistent basis. It's very difficult to accomplish routine work assignments. Critical thinking is frowned upon.Terrible place to work as a supplemental employeeThey will take advantage of you being a ""supplemental employee"" forcing you to work whenever they want you too. You get paid so little per hour compared to any other companies hiring right now that you legit have to work 2 jobs to survive and they also won't be rolling anyone over to ""full timer "" which gives you profit sharing and dental insurance for about the next 5 years.

Not thorough training.Work from homePayGreat pay and benefits, but..First off, I’d like to point out that I am a member of the Union at Stellantis.That being said, the Union-provided pay and benefits make the job worthwhile, as is the opportunity to help build a quality vehicle.Your just another bodyIt will take 4 or more years to be hired full time.You sign up for 3 or 6 days then they force you 7.Supervisors don't even know the jobs they want you to do and then write you up. Not what it use to be at all.Fast paced, high stress and undervalued. Entry level (supervisor) positions have high turnover.Hard work is not recognized nor appreciated. Work/life balance is awful. Lack of support, training and development from upper management/leadership. I've worked with some excellent, smart and driven supervisors over the past 3 years. Each of them left the company within 18 months.Not productive or fun place to work.This place is a helhole. Stay far away. This place will drain you of money, gasoline, and emotion. This place isn't great at all. Please please please.Great CompanyStellantis is a good company to work for and seems to be headed in the right direction. Alot of opportunity for growth and a good culture. I enjoyed working their, many different cultures to learn from.Great products and peopleAutomotive cyclical economy - but they don't just lay off employees, they try other reductions first.Don’t waste your timeThey fire people for dumb stuff. The ones who do their jobs , they put more on them while the ones who sleep while cars on the line get away murder . Favoritism is crazy, some full timers have their own TPt to do their work the shift. The job I wanted Stellantis claimed it was no longer available, yeah right! No growth or advancement unless you go to management but be prepared you won’t last long.Make your money and go home.This is no place for the weak, this job can physically and mentally drain you, don’t get sucked up in the negative energy, management doesn’t care about its workers, they will do the most to weed out their workers, the UAW Leadership is weak and most lack experience. With all that being said, you can make good money here if you want it, it’s there. Lots of OT, excellent benefits, profit sharing, quality bonuses, paid holidays, just to name some perks.Good benefits, Good Pay.Bad management weak uaw leadershipNaOverall a great company to work for. Compensation is on par with competitors. Not the best for opportunities to advance but this is related to the merger.Save your sanityYou need the free healthcare they provide because you will become depressed and broken down working there.I dreaded every shift and have worked there so long I have lingering effects in my body I’ll never get rid of.Free healthcarePay shift environment Co workers etcI hope everybody can get job like a Stellantis . Just because it is best company.The best company l ever worked in my life. Thank you Stellantis. They took care of me and family. God Bless Stellantis. I hope l will have an opportunity to work here until l retire. Again Thank you Stellantis.Easy work, but over workedI wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. If you would like to live at work then work 1 day a week outa no where. Sign yourself up. The worst work/life balance. Decent pay, okay benefits.Better Culture than my previous jobOne of the things I like about this job is that the culture is different. There is not a lot of division at the company. You have access to your supervisors, managers, and directors.Flexible work scheduleHeavy workload currently due to merger.BewareSince the merger there have been many changes. Growth opportunities are far and few between. No raises in several years and management attitude of just get it done with little to no direction. Don't waste your time. Continuous reminders about headcount reduction in an already skeletal organization.Working from homePay/Bonus, Demanding management, threat of job lossGreat company and perksSolid overall company with strong fiscal performance. Purchasing has very fair managers across the board And everyone helps out when needed. Compensation is above average to other companies in similar industry.Car program, compensation and health care awesomeCan feel lost since merger with company on both sides of oceanGood company to work good people.Really good company for young people.Benefits are above average.Salary is fair. Manager help you I'm your career development.People leaving is creating some pressure in the workload.Fair Salary, excellent vacation days.No opportunities to grow.Production line workJust like any plant same story different company.. hard work long hours good luck on getting any type of time off if you a TPT Or Supplemental EmployeeThe paychecksIf it were not for the pay, it would be hard to go into this place everyday. Amazes me how a multi-billion dollar company can be ran so poorly!! But I guess like all big corporations now days, they quit promoting from within and started throwing $$ at those college graduates to come in and be supervisors in a manufacturing facility unlike any they have ever seen.Pay and pretty much unlimited OT.The micromanagement is micromanaged...which makes it unbearable to tolerate sometimes.Not at all what they say it is. The money doesn't come quickly, you are looking at years basic investment of time.Not at all what they say it is. The money doesn't come quickly, you are looking at years basic investment of time If you are older when you start or have a large family, they dont care. You better do it like they tell you too. Very little allowance for anything else."
BI WORLDWIDE,"Decent Place to work but a 'fly by the seat of your pants' mentalityGood people, solid tools and decent management. The only issue was continually playing catch-up or transferring resources to stop the bleeding rather than hire more or improve processes.Free BeerLack of internal resourcesPoor training, lack of supportThe training document is old. Employees don’t help each other learn or function on the job. There’s lots of scapegoating. There’s too many org changes and lack of organization1Great corporate culture, led by our CEOBIW walks the talk. They build into their people and recognize great effort and achievement. They also highly value each employee and diversity and the different talents and perspectives our collective workforce brings.Small company allows your ideas to be heardBeing over 70 years old, some changes don't come as quickly as desired.1""we're just like family"" attitude - toxicwake up, go to work, sit around doing nothing except pointless work that could be avoided, given stronger operational effectiveness. weird work culture, awkward meetings, etc. good luck!food truck, work from homebad management, toxic work environment, obnoxious ""self help"" tips, fake togethernessAmazing EnvironmentI've worked at BI WORLDWIDE for over 20 years. I started in an entry level project administrative role and have had the opportunity to work my way up over the years into Project Management, Sales and Management. It's a global company with the stability and resources you would expect but with a small company feel and an executive leadership team that truly cares about our associates, not just about how much money we can make.if you want to feel good about the work you do, with supportive teammates, engaged leadership and opportunities for advancement, BIW is the place to do that.Great associates, ethical leadership, opportunity to growExternal client driven timelinesBest Employer in MinnesotaWorking at BIW is the best decision I have ever made. They truly value and care about their employees and treat them very well. If you are looking for a career this is the place to start.Excellent pay, benefits, and events!NoneAmazing folks at BIW. Great peers to work with!Great work place. Fifteen years working with various customers/internal/external/stakeholders/vendors in both product/project/delivery and development. Loved working with my managers and peers offshore, near shore and onsite.Summer of Love concerts and parties, Very Employee friendly organizationI can sell far less of my soul for far more elsewhereA typical day at BI starts with checking your messaging clients to figure out what task you are being assigned. You will work on projects of little to no educational value. The tech stack is old and the company truly feels like it is stuck in the 90's. There are no code reviews, no scrums, and the requirements are unclear, about the only way to impress is to beat the BI drum loudly. Your leads are generally engineers which weren't good enough to work literally anywhere else in town, because if they could, they would go make better money elsewhere and not play the scapegoating game like every other member of this organization. Management never answered anything directly, and then would become upset if you failed to respond appropriately to their lack of clarity. Technical staff are protective of information and nobody really wants to answer your questions about things like coding practices, testing standards, and project goals. I would say that most of your day is just trying to decipher what the unwritten rules are, and the hardest part of your job is going to be dealing with the overinflated egos of rather unimpressive individuals who believe that their titles mean anything. It is a tossup between that and watching your technical value wane as you work on problems that lack any intrigue with technologies that are irrelevant. The most enjoyable part of this job was finally realizing my self-worth after one last chastisement, picking up my phone, calling a recruiter, and being able to remove the company slack and email channels from my devices. If you want to know the feelingIt will teach you what to look for in a bad companyLow pay, bad working conditions, micromanagement, poor communication, office politics, unclear requirements, ridiculousDon't practice what they preachYou're expected to have a professional background but they pay poorly. This also leads to a less than ideal caliber of workers. Bringing bands in to entertain us is a slap in the face when you're struggling to pay rent.Great opportunitiesDiverse options for movement and advancement. Management is clear about advancement paths. Co-workers were great, clients were fine, lots of travel!It's a great freelance position.It is great working from home and working with a great creative director that trusts me and likes my creativity. We are usually on the same page and we have both been in the automotive business for a long time.I am on a great team and love itBI as a company is a large global company so I can't review anything other than the team of developers in Edina I am assigned as far as people are concerned. Each team is a bit different as each team leader is a bit different and are allowed to lead differently. I believe is a good thing when dealing with developers.My team is great and always great. Few times over the years I have had to work past 40hrs, but generally it is 40hrs a week which is NOT the norm for developers. Generally they are able to compensate you later (afternoon off) for working overtime. I am salaried, so it's not like I get paid extra per-say.Co-workers are amazing and even though pay is average, many stay because of the team. By average I mean good pay money wise, but average for your job compared to others. I have worked for more money and better benefits else where but also worked 50 - 60 hours a week on a regular basis.They did Summer of Love last two years I have been here, where they set up a bunch of activates and had lunch trucks come by (they gave you coupons to use for free/discounted lunches), doughnut and coffee breaks, and local bands come play.Only real complaint I have is some of the benefits are expensive and even paying for Health insurance on my own is cheaper then company offered with their help paying.Nit pick would be cubical city and no free drinks like coffee and/or water. They did do fruit every few days but that stopped.Great Team, Many company funded activities, flexible schedule if no meetingsCost of benefits, Cubical cityFamily atmosphereWhen I worked at BI, it was a cohesive, fun environment.

Uncover business issues with clients and work with internal teams to present recommendations.The people are great to work withThe people and company are great to work with and very stable over the years, as they continue to evolve. Great place to see all aspect of a business from selling to solutions.Extraordinarily welcoming and supportive environmentMy first day at BI Worldwide was easily the best first day I have ever had at a new job. This trend continued: everyone was supportive and friendly, and they all have a genuine desire to get to know you as a person and see you succeed as a colleague.Great place to workLearned a lot of new skills there and didn't have much of a skill set when they hired me. Very thankful for the opportunities to learn and improve myself there.Incentive programs should be used internally tooI never felt motivated or supported enough to want to help the people around me. Definitely an old school mentality from managers. Received zero help.Remote business development positionLong sales cycle, management lacking consistent direction in my particular region. Little opportunity for advancement as leadership seems entrenched as constituted.Some areas are great, some are not.In joining BI I was excited, I knew their clientele was of the global 100 and beyond companies. However, since my first month there has been nothing but attrition in the business unit I joined. A new leader was hired, and holy buckets it went from a good job prospect to toxic. While the leader is sales smart, they do not respect staff, vacation time or provide ANY positive employee recognition.

Their benefits are great, the culture is amazing (they often have free concerts, beer, food, and other events, not to mention take your dog to work Fridays in the summer) The management is also wonderful. It is a perfect place to gain experience in the career path you're looking for, and have wonderful opportunities for growth.Benefits, culturePayProceduresI think they need to do some thinking and re-evaluating their procedures now that everyone is working from home like the attendance and what is excused and what is not.Great benefitsFun company in an exciting field with great benefits like parties, generous PTO, profit sharing.

I liked working from a remote location out of the headquarters area, the client interaction and facilitating project with coordination of the internal team.

Typical day is inbound calls, emails and chats. Work telecommute. Great management, work hard and play hard.Work Hard, Play HardThis is one of the core principles of working at BI Worldwide and it is followed closely. Time flies throughout the work day here because there is always something to work on and very little downtime. This gives a great opportunity to continually better one's self professionally each and every day. When it's time for fun, BI Worldwide knows how to handle that as well. Concerts, food trucks, trivia, sports leagues, PTO, and more are all provided to the employees here and there are no judging eyes when one partakes. Lastly, each and every interaction with the CEO has shown that he genuinely cares about the employees under him and that is the cherry on top that is what makes this a great place to work at.N/aOK place to work. need more PTO, and to be paid more. The people were nice, but that's not the only reason to work at a job.

The job was located in Eden Valley which was 44 miles west of where I lived. I did not understand their program in regards to answering the phones and dealing with the customers. It was not a good fit for me in that respect.The company is changing with the times...I will admit that when I started, there were a few very tired policies that few agreed were fair - but now the company is moving in the right direction. It's a fun and safe place to work and explore - and a great place to really showcase your talent and gain more skill and competency. relaxed office!!!Relaxed office, great vacation package, good insurance, friendlyNot competitive enough - lack of vision in certain spaces to really compete in certain marketsVery funBeing a business incentive program manufacturer, the company really does a great job in “practicing what they preach”.

The most enjoyable part of the company is there is always something new to learn.AwfulUnless you are lucky enough to be assigned to a designated project (which is almost never allowed) you will only be performing the job of a Business Analyst about 5% of the time. The rest of the time you will be acting as a 24/7 on call help desk for whichever client you are assigned as well as other clients when there is a need to cover for absent co-workers. You will be expected to lie to the client when there is an outage to make it seem that the fault is not that of BIW. You will not be supported by your fellow BAs nor management. You will be expected to work as many hours as it takes to meet the unreasonable deadlines set not by knowledgeable BAs, developers, or project managers, but by the sales people.free fruit twice a weekno teamwork, unreasonable expectations, no support from managementvery rigidWorking here there is a very strict rigid time schedule you must follow making employees feel restricted in a sense. They do have programs to encourage being on time and showing up for work but seemed minimal.GoodNice place to work in here. Good team members to share knowledge. The most enjoyable part of the job is summer of love where we have parties, concerts.Behind the times for IT CompaniesTypically a day at BIW is very reactive to customer requests. There isn't much that is regular on a day-to-day basis, and while some thrive in this environment, others are stressed out.The management here is very interested in ""filling boxes"". They have pre-defined roles that people must adapt themselves into. This is different from some modern management ideas of keeping the people and fitting the roles to their strengths. So if you're looking for a place to make a role your own, this is not it. At least not at the level I achieved within the company.Office parties, relaxed dress codeOld software, resistant to changeOne of the best work place, lots of activities, including, concerts and BBQ'sBI has many departments, and have offices in many countries.

Very structured, which can slow things down. Lots to sell, but maybe too much.Nice benefitsVery silo'd need to change things up a bit.Comfortable work environment and team atmosphereBI Worldwide is very flexible when it comes to work/life balance. The accommodate the need to work from home to attend to other business provided all work gets done, meetings are attended and schedules are met. Team is easy going, however, the organization is so flat there is only one person in each job with no backup. This makes covering vacations difficult or if someone leaves the learning curve to fill that position is large.Flexible hoursJob stability, ""flat"" organization - no advancementThis is a great company to work for if you already know the people that work there.In reviewing BI Worldwide, it is my opinion that it is a great place to work if you know someone that already works there, or live in the town. Unfortunately, your raises do not reflect the work that you do on a daily basis. You can have one person that carries the weight of 5 people, gets good reviews, and maybe gets a $.20 cents per hour raise. Many of the people that work there like to spread rumors about their co-workers. And then there are others there that will not do their jobs, and get praise from the Management Team when they do one little part of their job just to appease their boss. Many of the temps that they bring in have no work ethic, sense of urgency, and lack loyalty and accountability. Many of the employees, due to the ""friendships"" with higher ups in the company, are able to get away with doing hardly anything; while other employees that don't ""schmooz"" with the bosses are expected to pick up the slack left behind. I have worked for much larger companies than this one, and have never worked in such a backward environment where even the Management team does not follow their own rules, nor do they get in trouble for breaking any of them. All in all, if you have never worked for a larger company to know the difference, you would probably think that this was a great company to work for; but if you have experience than you would know right away that there is something wrong with how the company is run in the small town.Sometimes the employees are given points to spend in the catalog, time off certificates, and other small incentives for doing a job well done.Too much favortism, too little compensation for a job well done, and not enough disciplinary actions taken against poor performances by employees."

They do pay well yes but that's about it.productive and rewardingI was a fellow for a bit at Microsoft and it was very very fulfilling work. They also let me do the project that I wanted which was a very very good front facing project involving city officials and more.Stay away Cloud DivisionsThe division of Microsoft responsible for cloud infrastructure is dysfunctional and poorly managed. While there are some extremely talented and collaborative people in the middle levels, management treats them as if they are disposable and creates an environment where trying to do the right thing is discouraged. Work life balance is non-existent, and far more time is spent blaming people for things beyond their control than actually working as a team to identify and then solve the problem.Smart and innovative people doing the workManagement, unrealistic expectations, acceptance of bullying by senior managersGreat team and amazing culture!Loved my time at Microsoft!

I recommend them tProductive and Fun placeI really enjoy working at microsoft. it's the best place in the world to work at. the people are super smart and i'm totally not just saying this to meet the wordcountContract work is not worth it here for the money but job was easyI worked as a contractor for MSFT and was grossly underpaid. Job was very easy and flexible. Job was kind of boring. No opportunity to get out of contract work.Mediocre pay, but overall good place to workBase salary is okay, but stocks are really minimal compared to other tech companies. Often you'll find your self out of things to work on and you need to really push hard with your manager to get visibility and subsequently promotionGood payThe work is very comfortable. I learned about team communication and social skills. The management cares for employees. Hardest part is learning. Enjoyable part is that I actually do not work here idiots.Productive and Fun PlaceI work as a product manager in Microsoft, the design and architecture of the IT products could make you learn a lot. The working environment is great with plenty of nice foo d and snacks.Avoid azure!!!Pros:- great benefits and competitive comp- free lunch on campus- lots of facilities on campus tooCons:- poor WLB- boring work with lots of on-call- devs depend on other internal services which are always brokenContractorLearned how to test software as a contractor in an ever growing world of professional software development and professional software testers and engineers.Great place to workI have worked for Microsoft multiple occasions as an FTae and contractor. All of the experiences have been positive. The culture is something that I really appreciate. You will find that there is always people who want to support you or give you great advice. They are focused on their employees to have a good balance between work and life.Professionally speaking, you'll find yourself understood and teams always welcome new ideas. Lots of resources and things you can learn. They are a great company focused on diversity and innovation.I worked with HCA and I'm not really sure why indeed is showing Microsoft. I answered as if I were reviewing HCA.I worked with HCA and I'm not really sure why indeed is showing Microsoft. I answered as if I were reviewing HCA. Working with HCA introduced me to a large blend of people that I would have never met had I stayed in El Paso before I moved to Dallas. It's a great environment to work in.Advancement and you learn alot while in the hospitals.Grinding work and long hours especially with an on call rotation.Great work/life balance and great place to workMicrosoft, in my opinion, is one of the more relaxing companies to work at. However, there doesn't seem to be much growth for contractors unfortunately depending on your position and team. All the food is subsidized and not free as well.However, the people are great and the working environment is usually great as well.Best work/life balance of all FAANGM-tier tech companiesMSFT is a great place to work if you want to get your foot in the door at a tier 1 tech company. It has its hand in every field in tech so you can always find a team that fits your needs in case you don't like the team you're currently on. The pay may not be as high as other companies, but it's well worth the better work/life balance.Career DevelopmentMSFT provides me an opportunity to learn new and exciting technologies, however, there is not a firm / clear career path for advancement. Given that MSFT is more of a products company, it still needs to mature its technology services organization.Mature CompanyMature Company with good benefits. Excellent healthcare, dental, and commuter benefits. Difficult to move up if in a lower level position.such as an admin or coordinator.Fast pace yet slow to changeMicrosoft is Big. Both in revenue and size. This creates interesting challenges. You could be working across time zones, you could be owning a piece of the business to manage. You own your work. However being able to influence change at the company is not that easy.Great benefits and work environmentOutstanding work environment, people and benefits. The pay is good but the benefits are the real selling point. In my experience management has been doing a great job.EhhhCulture is okay due to management, but overall feeling of belonging is low. The managers kind of view you as another cog. Would recommend this to others.Awful work/life balance. ""Customer is always right"" ideology that should have stayed in the past.This company is like a box of chocolates. You never really honestly know what you are going to get. The compensation and benefits are nice but other than that the working environment is just a front for truly stressful jobs.Of course, I think it all depends on luck. Because development teams have a clearer purpose and better benefits while there are teams where you are just a number.If you are not in the United States or another major city and if you are not a manager/dev/designer then look for something elsewhere.Benefits, compensation, ergonomical office supplyStressful environment, ancient ideals about support, awful work life balanceChallenging and rewardingOpportunities abound at Microsoft if you make a product with high impact. There are so many benefits. All of the benefits pretty much. And no micro m.Great Place to Develop Your Tech SkillsIt's Microsoft, they have all the resources for growth you can need. Very in-depth processes that help with daily responsibilities. Some of the processes can be unnecessarily complicated at times, but overall culture and management is very on-point and helpful.Fake Culture With a Stressful AgendaCulture is unfortunately very focused on brown nosing and lead by leaders supporting this practice. Tons of “whoop whoop” and fake “everything is peaches” meetings. Not a place for a positive mindset, little support for growth internally, and you will likely find yourself having multiple managers each year as it’s a rotating door with almost half the staff being new. Very large requisition loads (handling 2-3 recruiters jobs). Can’t recommend avoiding more despite the brand name.Poorly managed contract workI was on a team of contractors and most of them didn't know what they were doing. I often had to redo my coworkers' work. The work was monotonous and easy. I often had days where I had nothing to do. Because I was working through an agency, I was only paid hourly and felt both underpaid and underappreciated.Passive aggressive culture with limited opportunities for growthPassive aggressive culture with limited opportunities for growth unless you suck up to LT. Leaders lack diversity in leveraging different way employees work.good pay at a steep pricei averaged 2-3 managers during each fiscal year/performance review period for over a decade, never had a manager stay in role more than 1 yearthe sales and compensation numbers never matched and you have basically no recoursecustomers hate dealing with MSFT peopleculture is very cutthroat and your competing against everyone on your team and at your role level for your paybenefitsculture, managers, peers, customersAzure cloudYes!!! Amazing Cloud technology and service with SQL and their interfaces. I would prefer if they could integrate some of their platforms more into a whole lot more of recent android technology instead. Their interfaces and databases run so much better than android and I think I would stick to using Azure Cloud Storage technologyExciting workplace, good directionCompany leadership has changed. Much better than in the early 2000s. When the going gets tough, the old boy's network and culture kicks back in. Otherwise very positiveInteresting missionSlow leadership decisions at the topContracting at MicrosoftIn a relatively short MS contract, I had a supportive team who kept work in perspective while accomplishing the tasks at hand. My immediate manager helped me greatly grow my editing skills as I worked with him.Great company, learned a lot, expected to move up or out.Worked for Microsoft for 13 years. I learned a ton, enjoyed most of my roles, and felt like I had an impact. But, its a move up or out environment. Once thaey think you've reached your peak and won't continue to climb the latter they will move you out and bring up someone younger and still growing. Also, make sure you have a good manager.workplacegive us your opinion about a typical day at work what did you learn management workplace the hardest part of job the most enjoyable part of job do notGreat culture. Broad product spectrum. Poor salary.Working with Microsoft for the last 4 years. My reviews-1. Great culture.2. Really broad product spectrum.3. You can easily move to other teams.4. International opportunity.5. Poor refreshers even if you are exceptional employee. You have to move out after 4 years of time period.Microsoft = good company to work forI worked as a contractor at Microsoft and the team I was on was fantastic. I didn't feel like a contractor, just part of the team. I did have to work more than 40 hours to make an impact sometimes as there is a greater pressure on contractors because we have no stable role, so work/life balance was just okay (and no paid holidays), but our manager was really cool and made up for that.Hardest part of the job was that you need thick skin. They all say that, but you really do. Some managers curse and yell at you and you can't get HR involved because you're just a contractor. Also, a bit of nepotism going on. They pick favorites and it's clear who will get full-time and who won't.If you're wanting a laid back easy job, don't work here. You will fail.Good workplaceGood place to work, chill, opportunities to learn. However, pay increases have been minimal and it's not as easy to move internally compared to some other big-n companies"
Peraton,"Peraton has remote work options and is a a great place to work.Working at Peraton, you will find challenges that will test your IT abilities and work with clients for network troubleshooting and application based troubleshooting.

Good pay but really bad company to work with. Don’t work hereDifficultPays well but HR and corporate are EXTREMELY clueless about what is happening with their employees. Constantly making mistakes and putting their employee on the chopping block to cover their shortcomings.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?I have enjoy working a Peraton Good people and Good leadership.

Everyone is disposable.Poor transition to bigger companyThe company handled the integration of Perspecta and Northrop Grumman IT poorly. Frequent organization changes with little to no communication to employees. Losing a lot of top talent at all levels.Garbage leadershipLeadership has no backbone and changes their mind more often than they change their underwear. WFH for 2 years and then they bring us back in with no explanation as to why and no opportunity for WFH.Could be so much betterPay is decent. Benefits are extremely too expensive but if you have health issues, it's worth it because it covers a lot of things. People backstab and use you as a scapegoat. Seniority is king.missions, good group of peopleeverything elseDepends on the clientHas a lot of potential, but communication is a growing pain. They do try to take care of their employees but solidifying communication channels would be beneficialGood place to workDecent pay and good benefits but they are atill a contracting company so you must stay billable to stay employed. The are a young company but are doing a decent job of bringing the three companies togetherExhaustingLike many others said, not a bad place to start. Workload is not sustainable. Focus on production over quality of work at times. Lack of training for certain assignments.It's a steady jobNot much say so in how things are done, if you like this thing called SAFE agile, maybe you like it. The pay is basic and training is informal when they have itA good m-f repetitive job that offers no movementEasy job but the tasks are mind numbing and dull. Boredom is my largest enemy and the inability to change hours or move positions makes the job dull. If you can tolerate the same task everyday you can probably retire here.Decent pay, easy workNot challenging, little advancementA great company to work for.The people at Peraton are achieving great things. I am grateful to have been a part of it. The leadership made certain that all team members had the tools to perform their jobs effectively and thus provided the absolute best customer service to their customers.Great place to work...Very innovative company, with a great sense of purpose. I've learned new things at least once a week since being here and anticipate learning more. Overall, I love my job as a whole, however the goals of my position are completely unrealistic, which leads to feelings of failure every once in a while (but not constantly). My management team is wonderful, we get to do things other people don't, and the work environment is beautiful.toxicI was employed for several years and each year was progressively worse. Total toxic environment with a fixation on unrealistic productivity expectations and a clear focus on profit and winning that next contract. My work was never good enough and faced constant scrutiny and threats of discipline if it was not the exact thing they expected to see in the reports. It was as though the product fitting an expected outcome was more important than actually screening candidates for the position properly. Not every candidate deserves the job, yet it seemed that this company would rather focus on checking boxes. The company claimed competitive pay, but I now make more money delivering food than I ever did working there. Sick pay existed but you were discouraged from using any, and deadlines were still there whether you took time off or not. If you like being the scapegoat or being kicked when you're down, then it's for you.nonevery low pay, toxic culture, unrealistic stats expectations, numbers and profit mattered more than employee healthConstant encouragement to learn and excelI started as an ISSM and after 12 months was encouraged to apply as the Deputy Operations and Infrastructure manager.I have wonderful hard working team mates who really make a difference. We do the can’t be done!Good place to workI am on a Government IT contract and Peraton is great place to work. I would recommend this company to my friends and family. Peraton also pays well.Peraton has remote work options and is a a great place to work.Working at Peraton, you will find challenges that will test your IT abilities and work with clients for network troubleshooting and application based troubleshooting. It is a great place to grow your skills in IT with a great client base.Top quality organizationBeen an employee almost ten years. Been some trying times, but anyone gets that with any organization. Completely satisfied with the contracts we support.1The company is top notch but getting hired and getting through their bizarre background check border lines unethical and definitely unprofessional.Applying to the company for background investigator and I have 15 plus years of operations and special investigations. My point of contact and prospective team lead was awesome. However, their own subcontractor that does the background investigations is about the most second rate investigative entity I have ever seen. They were asking for my pay stubs, my w-2s, etc things that the intelligence community never even asks for in a standard form 86.Put a very bad taste in my mouth and wasted about 2 weeks of my time and because of this and not because of the company itself I would never work for them unless they changed the contractor that does supposed investigations.Incredibly disappointing and it makes the company look amateur which in fact they are not!16Great place to learnIf you want to get your foot in the door, this is a great company to do that at. The company gives me everything I need and ask for, and the flexibility is great.Unfortunately the department I work in is a bit cliquish and work is only assigned to certain people. I’m a very highly driven person, so when I don’t get work, I get frustrated.Not every department is like that. Overall, a great place to go.Kinda StressfulIt is a tough work life. Often have to work more than necessary. The pay does not really match the stress that comes with the job. My coworkers are really nice and supportive people though. It makes the job a little more bearable but, overall not fun.Good place to work, but dont expect much of a work/life balance. You are always on the clockGood company to work for, the benefits got bad at the new fiscal year. They switched to literally medicaid benefits. So if you have medication, expect to pay almost full price for it.PTO Remote opportunitiesOff time is not yours Benefits are the same as medicaid.Good Not GreatMy manager is great, my coworkers are too and everyone feels like they are happy. I just know I am underpaid for the amount of time and experience I have.Flexible, Great coworkersunderpaidThere are really good people at Peraton.My Manager/PM treated our team like royalty. The company is going places. There is a lot of good opportunities there. If I could've stayed there, I would've, no doubt!Much better places to workIdeal for employees looking to retire in next five years or with minimal prospects for transfer. Competitors are outpacing Peraton in ways to invest in key areas and innovate. Partner companies are finding difficulty in closing deals and actualizing investments to translate into real growth and are finding better luck with competitors.You can work remote but you'll work 10 hours a dayPoor training, management, benefits.Long Hours. Poor pay. Management talks to you like your stupid.Training is slammed onto you and your expected to understand and work real / complex cases literally while still in training.work from homlong hours, lots of cases, low moralOpportunities for the lone wolfCompany mostly handles background checks for clients. Some IT service contracts with government agencies. Lots of chances to work with different tech.Work life balanceWorking alone on various different projects, Software developer job descriptions not well definedGreat place to work as a software engineerWorked for the company (the company that became Peraton) for 30 years. The people were great - very professional and the work was always interesting.Completely changed my view of government contractorsHaving only worked in the commercial and private sector, I was initially apprehensive about joining a government contractor. I assumed that they were all ""slow"" in terms of innovation and change. My team at Peraton has shattered these expectations - everyone is smart, capable, and willing to constantly learn and help others. I'm really happy here and adequately compensated for my time and work.Great company overall, but with useless HR and managementThe teams I have worked with have all been great, but anytime I need to interact with Peraton itself, I'm basically ghosted.Working from home makes it hard to rate this company fairlyIt's a new company and they are still trying to iron out some kinks, but overall the management is at least trying to treat its employees well. I guess your satisfaction would depend on what project you are working on. Would have liked XMas bonuses. Working from home makes the entire experience feel though like I do not have a fair flavor of what Peraton is really like. If it is actually like anything other than a bunch of contracts for different services stapled together...Pay and benefits are pretty goodHard to figure out what is going on with the companyContractorIf you are working as a contractor and work at the customers facility, you won’t hear much or get that much support from contract company. Out of sight out of mind. Haven’t heard much from company or outside leadership since coming to the company.Poor payThey do not pay their Investigators what they’re worth. Find another company for much more money. Making your own schedule is nice but the management doesn’t care and will make sure you aren’t paid fairly.Too big to care about employeesCompany growing too fast to respond and take care of employees—too busy managing merges. Local employees are afterthoughts, but expect employees to go above and beyond “Do the can’t be done.”Consistent Work FlowThere's never a dull moment working at Peraton. The work flow is consistent. They offer additional training in multiple fields of interest for both current field and future career opportunities.Technical work can be interesting but hampered by over-reaching policyManagement is focused on slimming down costs yet dramatically increasing sales in hope of another merger or perhaps taking the company public. The company went from ~5k employees to over 20k in less than a year due to mergers. It seems like upper management does not know what to do with most of the companies they bought. Many talented folks left recently due to reorganization.Remote friendlyIT lock down of your laptop - developers can't even install minor tools, No real job advancement for technical folks without moving to sales or management, Complete focus on billable hours.NopeNo one takes you seriously since COVID. Can’t go into field for work, no one calls you back,interviews lack personal contact.No colleague interaction.Peraton has remote work options and is a a great place to work.Working at Peraton, you will find challenges that will test your IT abilities and work with clients for network troubleshooting and application based troubleshooting. It is a great place to grow your skills in IT with a great client base.Good company growing rapidly.Company is growing rapidly and there are lot of opportunities. It will need time to find the equilibrium with all recent mergers. But outlook is good.1They like to bring you in with fantastic salary and promised benefit that disappears or changed after 6 months.I went with the company because of the salary. There is no work life balance. Horrible greedy, and practically uselrss managers. I left there in August of 2021. They still can't replace me at the same salary. It's a toxic place to work.91Low pay, Not a supportive environment if you are not a favorite of the management and no HR on site since CovidLow pay and not very supportive unless you are a favorite of upper management. HR is not on site and if you have any issues - good luck. Not very good raises and a lot of micromanaging .Nothing after CovidSmall cubicles and work environment for 20 people. Not a growing or healthy place.Solid company.Good company. Very solid. I always felt like a team member and not just a name on a roster. The company seems to grow via acquisitions, which can be unnerving at times. But, otherwise, a pleasure to work for.Solid company.Lots of mergers. My head was spinning.Company has grown rapidly but in the process no longer agile and responsive to employees.Company has grown too fast and is not taking care of the employees as it should. It started as a smaller company (3,500 employees), and touted the fact that it could be more agile and responsive to employees. Then within a year and a half, through expansion it grew to 24,000 employees. So much for being agile and responsive.Much is touted about the CEO and yes, kudos to him for growing the company so rapidly. But things have been lost along the way for its employees. Many feel they are just a number now.Perhaps less patting itself on the back and more sincere concern for employees?Overall the pay isn't bad, and most benefits seem to be right in the middle of the pack with other companies.Managers need to have no more than 10 to 12 employees but some managers have 20 or more employees, Company should provide training to employees that have professional certifications to maintain, 401(k) Savings Plan could provide more employer matching, Make merit based bonuses more visible and attainable to employeesFlexible but low payGreat benefits, have some flexibility. The pay is just not good. The culture between departments is also really awful. Other people who you never talk to decide your bonus.BenefitsPayVery stressful but meaningful workThey do not allow telework which is a huge bummer. But the people are super good to work with. Management seems to have a disconnect between creating new policies and how work actually needs to get done.No culture. No leadership. No trust.No support from corporate office. PTO days taken away. Lost 5 days. From 30 to 25. Broken promises from CEO. No loyalty and no empathy. Executives interested in own self wealth and future payouts.A lot of work - do more with lessDo more with less and lessThis company is such a jokeLiterally got laughed at during the interview process so unprofessional. Work life balance is nonexistent and the pay is not enough to live off of. Management is not understanding or helpful. Only took this job because I needed something but now moving on after 2 years.No day is the sameField manager is great, very supportive. Work life balance not so great. Your day can go left in a minute, hard to get overtime, hard to get some people to return your calls. Burn out will happen. Really can’t establish relationships with co-workers as you work alone and remote. Job has been difficult since COVIDPay is okNot enough hours in a day to complete all that is expectedNo fun due to COVID’s restrictions.The manager has her own policy. The CEO is thoughtful but some of the people that manages the employees are thoughtless. Further, some of the managers need to reconsider their operational method / styles. Treat people right!!!Worst company to work for if you have a familyThey preach family first but in all reality it’s all about their bottom dollar. Health care almost tripled for family dependents and their explanation is that they don’t have to give what they were giving. The pay is low, corporate doesn’t care about their employees and management will stab you in the back. There are many government contractors out there so please do yourself a favor and choose anyone but this one.Work life balanceBenefits, management, they do not care about you or your familyHorrible experienceMost of the employees there are great to work with. Management lacks people skills and there is no HR department there. The security department FSO lacks knowledge and skills and is a joke. In less than a year, two very good security assistance left because they could not and chose not to deal with the FSO's unprofessionalism and hateful attitude.The FSO plays favoritism and chooses who is in violation and who isn't. Management is aware but turns away and pretends not to notice because they're lazy and don't want to take the time and effort to deal with it. Shame on them!Decent benefits lolThey loose good people, and are either too ignorant or too blind to see why, or just don't care as long as their paycheck keeps comingProductive and professional work place.Great work environment for the most part. They had a great knowledge base to learn from. There was always plenty to do so most days went by quickly. Direct management was open and easy to talk too.Ability to work remote, provided all accentual equipment and had plenty of paid time off.Healthcare was ok until there was a major expense. Small teams meant working OT most weeks.Terrible PlaceThe micromanagement was horrible. The managers and IA team consistently look for reasons to question your integrity. They don’t like it when you use the PTO that you earned and give push back for sick time. All the company cares about is pushing cases through and they have completely lost sight of the nation’s security.NoneEverythingClear communication from company as a whole, but not compensated for workI am credentialed in multiple contracts and easily work more than one on a daily basis. Each contract requires additional training and is done a little differently than the others. You are expected to do the same amount of work, in the same amount of time, regardless of how much extra time you spend on additional contracts.Make your own scheduleForced to work multiple contracts but not compensated any differentlyGood place to workGood place to work and management is best. It is fast growing company in IT consulting and There are lots of opportunity for growth . I recommend it to any one.Horrible CompanyThey acquired a smaller company I was with and brought in their Amazon toxic culture to manage all aspects of the company which led to people being managed out. They've embraced the Amazon metric system model for employees. Worst experience I've ever had working for a contractor.Pay and benefitsEverything else.Good people but not a flexible environmentThe problem are good. The managers are kind but the job is very stressful. Expectations can be high especially and hard work goes unnoticed. Lots of requests are unnecessary and a time waste especially when it comes to coming into work instead of remote.Decent benefitsBad pay. StressfulGood company with great benefitsIt's a good company to work for, however, the team lead had no sense of how to lead a team. Most of the time, I had no idea what other members of my team where doing, which created a feeling of loneliness. Never could get through one project without having to jump on another."

I was Honestly Excited for the opportunity, until I came in contact with the Franchise manager/technician. I’ve worked there for 4 weeks…meet some stand up gentlemen/technicians, no positive feedback from each and every one . Gave the Branch a chance for myself, such a terrible experience, good luck to all Applicants , just a FYIBenefitsFranchise/ Branch managerEnvironment required alot of safety management at their main facilityVery unsafe environment for the workers. The facility was very rough unsafe. The leaders at the facility were too entrenched to see the unsafe issues.Great company to work for!I came from the restaurant industry and the transition to this industry has been smooth. Great benefits, flexible time off, and they reward you with COOL points for doing a great job. They have a big emphasis on safety training and promote a safe work environment overall. Would recommend this job to anyone looking to get into a new industry.Better than a poke in the eye....BarelyHorrible...Horrible...Once more for emphasis...HORRIBLE company and work environment. This company is almost a cliche' of corporate insanity. The harder you work, they less they appreciate it.If you like working for scumbags this place is for you.Name it..The list is endless.Depends on your department and your teamI feel it’s definitely difficult to find your place at Lennox however they pay well and most employees who have amazing 5+ year tenure love it. There isn’t much flexibility Within some teams to work remote if that is a desire for you. I felt like it was very “clickish” and hard to identify with the culture unless you lose yourself and what you believe in. If you want to play by the rules, be compensated well and are looking for a long term career this is the place for you. I feel like this is a great opportunity for older professionals with tons of experience but not so much for younger professionals looking to add something to the position.The company culture is nice, but some management people don't have the necessary technical skills to direct the research work.The company culture is nice and workload is appropriate.

My colleagues had knowledge to share as well as younger upand coming technicians to pass my knowledge to. It was a good environment when I worked there and I've spoken to the current Manager that was a tech when I was employed working with him so there is obviously room for in house promotion.Bad experienceWorking at this place was the wrong choice, never recommend this company to any one I was there working for 2 years and it was a really bad experienceVery employee friendly... For now.Great atmosphere to work in. Very much a place that cultivates the cult of the corporation. The hours can be long and boring, so it takes a bit of time to get your stride. Then1hr lunch didn't help things move by any quicker, especially since there's a small but decent cafe there. It's quick and easy but 1hr is a bit long of a break. It slows everything down & just really makes the day so much longer. Since you're at a computer the day drags on & on.There is a lot of stuff to do socially through the company, including LYPA the Lennox young professionals association. If you can swing office life, I definitely recommended Lennox , it's a challenging but rewarding job and you're going to be taken care of ragehr well. Greg place to work for the next 30-40yrsdisorganized bad managementjust blah its a job bad management disorganized no one cares about efficiency in my department outdated system no harmony or smooth work processes just crazyits a jobbad managementNot a good place to work atThey only train you for two days and then you in your on. Then they move you to different spot on the line without much training. Line supervisor cuss worker like a dog. You have to work 7 day week with no life outside of lennoxYou can pay lunch thereWork you 7 days a week no time for your familyIt’s a job.If you need a job, they’ll give you one, no hassle. Interview process is very simple. It’s mainly paperwork and a drug test. The way you don’t get hired is if you fail the drug test, background check, or both.Decent benefits and bonusesYou’re working all the time. No work life balance.Can provide you with a great life if you can handle working everydayGood company to work for to achieve quick financial stability.....minimal time off but after a year you to get paid vacation......work hard and you will see it financiallyDecent payNo paid time off until 1 year of employmentWork too stressful management sucksNeeds better management company doesnt respect people below them all they are worried about is money. They work us to death with a lot of overtime and on call.Fun place to work with people of all backgrounds.Great solid company with lots of opportunity to grow and advance if your willing to relocate. Great leadership, employee stock plan, matching 401k. Management changes are normal and you have to be willing to adapt to new styles. Great company to start with and grow your knowledge or make a career with if you pay attention and make career moves at the correct times.Good work hours, no weekends, good benefits. Ability to work unsupervised.Lack of local upward mobility, Have to move to be promoted or transfer to corporate offices in Dallas, Vacation is less than other companies of similar size, New hires are paid close to long term employees, Helps to be a yes person and just do what management says without questions to help make sense.Very serus and foucesd work .For the self-starter can be a great job. Safety is very important for this company. Direction can be lacking at times. Constantly changing and growing.Safety conciseUpword mobility is low. No revews or pay raises.Could be a good place to work with different managementUpper management very shady. Will punish the hardest workers by giving them the most work without extra pay. Positions given not according to work ethic but because of relationship with boss. Coworkers are great but most of the upper management just aren’t good people and gossip to other workers and can be very inappropriateWork/life balance Bonus Benefits CoworkersSome of upper management treats people like dirt, Some upper management has “too close” of relationships with other coworkersHorrible management. No work/life balance.Lennox Stuttgart,AR works their employees 7 days a week. Can not keep employees, and does not pay what is needed for those that stay. Their is no work/life balance due to having to work 7 days a week. They took earned PTO for working overtime away and force you to take a incident for taking a day off. Poor management poor company to work for. Needs a overhaul.NoneEverythingWork you to deathAlways behind and understaffed. Pay below average in the area. Management does unethical things and sweeps things under the rug to get get jobs closed out and billed.Will always have workNo work life balance, get ready to loose your familyGreat company.Great place to work. People never leave. Good work life balance. The company seems to care about their employees. Sick time is an honor system plan. Mentorship program and young professionals group available.No incentives to work hard7 days a week without end in sight and pay could be better aligned with national average. Absolutely no structure and management needs a complete overhaul.Nothing comes to mind7 days a week. Unorganized. Poorly managedThey have no respect for there works and there supervisor are not goodThey are very unprofessional and wouldn't recommend them. They have no sympathy for there workers at all. They fire you and you wouldn't know they fire you. The manager and supervisor they play games which means they got there picks and chooses. They are unfair and unjustice.Short break and no care for the workersGood Company To Work For!!Wonderful people to work with.Steady work and opportunity for advancement.Benefits could be improved- get rid of 401K and go back to profit sharing retirement!!!Allot of interaction with each other and with sharing important aspects of over all performance of company.Good working conditionsSome employees are not productive, while others are overloaded.Could be BetterPay is decent...Benefits are okUpper management needs to plan things betterNot enough staff across all 3 shiftsIt's work to volume...OT during weekFellow employees are great to work withSome heavy lifting...wearing steel toe/composite shoes can take a toll on your feet.BenefitsUnder staffedGood job, good companyLII is just a good solid place to work, a rarity these days. The campus is in N Dallas and has typical corporate amenities including cafe and gym. In addition, there is free covered parking.stabilityold school mentality regarding work from anywhere, but changingThe company culture is nice, but some management people don't have the necessary technical skills to direct the research work.The company culture is nice and workload is appropriate. Some management people don't have the necessary technical skills to provide guidance for their workers.Culture is good. They hire smart people in management which is important.I was in business development so I traveled a lot. Management is good at identifying your strengths and then “they ride you for all you got.”They pay you fairly and treat you well, as long as you contribute (which is how it should be!).Toxic work environment. Toxic management. Constantly under staffed. Poor recruiting and HR model.Good company ruined by bad management. Running off all of the good employees. This toxic environment goes all the way to the CEO. They have the same model at all of their plants. Burn out their employees, get new ones. They take the risk on poor quality products.3Lots of overtime 6 and 7 days a weekThis company make central heat and air units but the plant stays around 94 degrees and then you wear PPE the work isn't hard but the environment and policy is terrible they change rules to fit whatever they want hold some people accountable let others get away with everything they put to much pressure on some making work terrible while not even saying anything to others that have been there for years and are breaking all the rule double standards.I can't think of a single thing.Everything!! Overworked under paid for the environment and not ever having a lifeShort staffed all across the company, management, payManagement thinks they can talk to you any type of way. The air conditioning in the building does not work properly. The company is so short staffed that most employees are working 5 or more jobs and being moved to different lines every day. The lie about all raises and there are too many relationships going on between employees and supervisorsThis job is only a pay check.Management only looks out for those who do not question their decision making. June 2021's Employee retention raises were severely lop-sided. Hard working employees who had the company's best interest in mind (but were also verbally outspoken against Management policies) were given the lowest raise(s) and those who were personal friends with management received the highest raise(s). There is absolutely no accountability for those who do the bare minimum. 95% of employees consider their 8 hour shift ""social hour"" and get nothing done. Lennox is a company where everyone ELSE is responsible for everything, so therefore not too much gets done. This company is literally a revolving door. Some employees come and go whenever they want without consequence. This is a good place to work until you find something else more meaningful and challenging.Benefits.No accountability towards others who don't work hard.Horrible placeTenured employees complained a lot, wouldnt change jobs though due to older age and close to retirement. Coaches favored certain employees, down talked new hires. Multiple tasks assigned in work area, short staffed all the time.NoneLow moraleNeed better trainingManagement cares but they have their favorites. They tend to lean towards people who mostly align with their beliefs. They hire anyone with a pulse. Went to 3 shifts and won't discipline those who make major mistakes.Free lunch for major holidays.Lack of formal training.Lennox is horribleThey do not care about there employees in the slightest. They will get rid of you for the next person on a whim. They don't care how you feel or your health. You are there to make bad quality funaces with bad parts from Mexico who's plant is air conditioned while the one here in the states is not.PaycheckBureaucratic peoplePoor culture driven by executive teamExecutive management is not interested in process improvement, instead they throw more people at bad processes and move the work to India due to lower labor cost.Talented individuals who truly want to make a difference are overworked and leave for better opportunities.Lack of accountability by management.Pay, managers get own officePTO is 2 weeks which includes sick time, Management does not care about employees, long hoursGreat company!Awesome opportunity with great training. Work-life balance is very fair, great benefits, and ability to advance. Company encourages learning and training with amazing support provided. Opportunities for relocation, with company support.Training, work-life balance.Staff reduction fluctuates due to Covid.Fun place to workGreat people to work with respectful environment interity of people is great and always striving for excellence. It was a great culture when I was there.Work life balancedNoneTerrible place to work!!!During the interview process they painted a great picture. After two weeks at work I suffered a hernia. They didn’t even offer to take me to doctor, and had to cover all expenses on my own. They believe they own you, there is no room for personal life. They work you 12 hours days seven days a week. Pay scale is extremely low, doesn’t even matter your experience. They expect top notch technicians but refuse to pay decent wages. No incentive for on call, they won’t even tell you a schedule. You’re at home and all of a sudden get a call and your expected to drop what you’re doing and go run a call. Four people quit in less than 2 weeks. Management has total disregard for employees, employees come last!! Horrible experience working there!! DO NOT recommend working there, unless you want to be underpaid and overworked!!NoneTreat employees like property, and try to work them to deathAlways Traveled out of N.Y stateThey Had No Organization skills, they had No Management Assigned to My State, or Area,they Hired A Service manager with No Service,or Management Experience! Overall Do not Take A job From this Company!Good BenefitsGot Heat Exhaustion on a Roof after 10 hrs in the Sun, they were more concerned about Their Reputation, than their WorkersHardest part of my jobHonestly, the hardest part was when I resigned. From the time I started the leadership in the Finance department changed and it was for the best!! If you are offered a position with Lennox I recommend you stay! :)gym, team building, parking garageno vacation during xmas and new yearGreat place to work.I worked for Lennox as a .NET Developer. The location is great. The Cafeteria and the fitness center are also great. As I had been working as a contractor I had to leave after the completion of my project. I would gladly be permanent had they offered me the opportunity.Fitness center, Cafeteria, beautiful surrounding.Job security (as a contract employee)Being considerate of other.I am joyful to have a job at lennox. Its not to much wear and tare on the body. Pay is satisfactory. I would perfer a longer lunch break. They can show more love for the workers. As far as recognizing the severeness of weather.The free lunches is good.The lunch breaks could be longer.Office workI enjoyed not doing the same thing all the time, but I hated that I was put on jobs they knew I didnt like. I had a hard getting along with some of the management. My perception of the lead and supervisor was they didnt like me and would give me a hard time because of it, but maybe my perception was off. Either way I ended up having to quit because of points missed due to my children being sick. Sucks to have to go out that way and they could careless.Learned a lot about inventory management, most employees were awesome!No give with personal lives.Great people and love the team environment in my departmentGreat people and love the team environment in my department. I enjoy the daily interactions with those that I get the pleasure to work with and speak to the most.Fitness Center, CafeteriaCasual work place with great team but below average payThe Salaries are below industry standards, but the team and people are great. Management is quick to recognize good work. Progress in company is based on hierarchy and years of experience instead of actual progress in career.Cheap Filters once a year. Great culture and peopleAverage payLook elsewhereManagement sucks. Overworked and underpaid. Would rather go homeless and jobless than work for this company again. I went union because they do not have comparable benefits, pay and respect for their employees."
"Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.","accepting fun environmentCan be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help.2Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us.Productive, fun and relax environmentI have worked at Tandem for over a year and love it. I plan to work here til I retire. The atmosphere is amazing, you also have the ability to work from home. Coworkers and higher ups are always willing to helpThis means so much to us to know that you are having such a great experience. Thank you for all that you do and looking forward to this journey ahead together!A Great Place for Software Testers to Work and LearnOn the whole, Tandem Diabetes Care is a welcoming company to work for if you truly care about helping the lives of people with Type I Diabetes. The people there help and support each other so that projects and other tasks can be completed, but also to come up with (and possibly even implement) some new ideas that can improve the lives of patients.Hybrid work arrangement, predictable work schedule (with some flexibility), highly collaborative and supportive company culture, supervisors help you to grow and develop on the jobCommute was to an area I had not driven to before, wish it could have lasted longerThank you so much for sharing your experience and for all the work you did with us! Wishing you the best on your future endeavors.Productive work- wonderful co-workers!I love with the best group of people. I am a pump therapy sales specialist and tandem has taught me so much. Both professionally and personally. What a blessing it is to work here!Bonuses-on going career developmentShort breaks-can be lonelyNeeds ImprovementThe process of training is so fast it’s hard to feel good about assisting anybody with diabetes when you’re not ready. As with any establishment it could be better but that’s up to the company to put that effort in .Company helps those with diabetes but it is the worst company to work forI worked at this company on the Care Bears team. One person that I work with that promoted to Supervisor and the manager over the department was horrible both of them Were!! If you're in an older employee they don't like to keep you around and they put so much pressure on you and it was the worst experience ever they do not care for employees they only want to make money it's the bottom line because they tell you they want you to connect with the customer and you do that and then you get in trouble and the manager and supervisor were hypocrites and the worst management that I have worked under in my over 35 years of experienceGreat, but like all places, could have been betterGreat company with opportunities to move forward. The only issue was with the BLM movement and they blatantly told us they would not support it then decided on a DE&I committee. Favoritism. Do not have a fake it until I make it spirit. But those who can fake it, usually do make it .Great ManagementManagement is great, there is a sense of belonging and the company really takes care of employees. One of the best companies I have worked for. There are opportunities for advancement and learning something new.coworkers pretty goodthe people here are great! if you like talking to customers all day this job is for you. only thing bad about this role is that hours and work schedule kind of sucksFun exciting career with room for growth! Great compensation for the area.Tandem is a great place to work. Their pay is competitive for the Boise area. They have flex/hybrid schedules beyond COVID. The facility is top of the line. Management is a group of leaders - not bosses, very open and collaborative work environment.Many schedule options, great compensation, management, culture, and awesome values/mission statement that they truly stand behind.Benefits could be a little better but overall pretty good.Work from home (at least at the moment) with great coworkersBeen here for a couple months as a temp, great for the most part. Great coworkers and supervisor, i just wish training had been more job specific. Work can be stressful on some days, but there’s great work-life balanceWork from home, positive and friendly atmosphere.Training could have been longer and/or job specificProductive job. Management cares and listens to you. Friendly co-workers.It was a good place to work at despite the uncompetative pay. Really good people to work with and really good management that cares about employees. Also good benefits.good benefits. friendly-environment. good management.payDo not recommend.The only thing that I liked about working with this company is that they are one of the few companies that offer 4/10s and 3/12s in San, Diego BUT management is really poor. It doesn't matter how much you love your job despite the pay management sucks. DO NOT WORK FOR 1st SHIFT CARTRIDGE. Supervisor and lead will ruin your life. I feel like they wake up every morning and decide to make everyone's life as miserable as theirs. Not worth working in a company with a toxic environment, low pay, and poor management. There are also no opportunity to grow because they will keep you where you are as much as they can.Medical, dental, and vision insurance are cheap, offers stocks, schedule, etc.No 401k matching, no room for growth, poor management, toxic work environment, etc.Very micromanagedThe people are great for the most part. Remote work is great. Pay is fair enough. They hire a lot through temp agencies however and the hours told to you are changed almost right away, and then after that you are expected to adhere down to the second to your schedule and you don’t get any PTO or sick time. If you call in sick it’s counted against you which they don’t tell you until later as well.Nice peopleMicromanagefun worlplaceAt one time or another, an incident or a violation can happen in the workplace. It’s the people form a workplace so these occurrences are natural. When this happens, it is the general practice to fill out an employee write-up form to clearly explain and record the incident or violation. This gives your employees the chance to know what violation they have committed and how it happened.Excellent on-boarding training. Impatient HR and Management.I was appointed through a staffing agency as a Software Tester. The interview process was easy and cool. I didn't feel like they needed much from a candidate. They mentioned you don't have to worry we are going to provide you the training.The training material and the trainer was really good.For first two days I didn't get access to the training material and hence I was lagging in the training and hands on practice on the tools they use.I was worried a little that I won't be able to finish it in the given time frame. I was told that this was the first time they are experimenting with short time frame of training period hence they have buffer time included in training itself. I felt relaxed.I passed both the assessments, practical and theoretical, in the given time frame and was given some extra time to practice on the tools they use, before I would be assigned to a team.I was quite happy and satisfied with that my trainer scheduled one more assessment before assigning me to the team. I was confident as I had got enough time to practice the tools they use. On the day of my second assessment (which was not the part of the training but mutual agreement between me and trainer, so that I feel more confident) My assessment was scheduled after lunch but I got a call in the morning that Tandem no longer wanted me to continue.I was shocked what went wrong, they must give explanation for termination. How can anyone decide just in 3 weeks of period if the candidate is best fit or not? That has caused me lot of stress and made me lose my confidence.They provide good training before assigning you to the team.They fired a trainee just in 3 weeks, even before the assessment was done from their side. No explanation was given.Productive and Fun place to workGreat place to work. Management is super nice and willing to help. Co-workers are great to help out as well. Most customers are nice and happy when they call.When I worked there it was remoteSome customers are angry when they callDon’t work for cartridgeThis is a very toxic work environment. Leads and supervisor show favoritism towards others, they will expect a lot of work from you and won’t recognize any of your hard work. They only care about reaching their goal number, not so much about the quality, hardly anyone follows the work instruction, they take short cuts to everything. The pay is not worth it, you will be getting paid the same pay as people doing nothing while you’re doing the work of 3 people. Company makes a lot of money yet they’re cheap asfPotlucks, free soda machineOverworked and underpaidGreat Place to workExperience varies greatly depending on your department and role. QA is rewarding here as you see the impact of your job on the product, process, and customer experience. You get what you put in, if you ask for more responsibility and have a clear direction of what you want, management will guide you there (sometimes). Education such as certificates / continued learning programs are supposedly paid for but I haven't seen it yet. Management here can be described as high level guidance and goals without micromanagement. The workplace culture is the most relaxed I've ever been a part of. Do your time, get your work done, work from home sometimes, just show results and meet deadlines. Management sometimes provides meals but mostly, the workers do potluck style lunches. Hoping Throwback Thursdays make a return (happy hour after work) after Covid. The work itself is very basic. You can skate by just doing the bare minimum and never learning anything and bore yourself for 10 hours a day doing repetitive tasks. Management will try to push tasks on you based on your abilities though and encourage growth. Best part of the job are the people!Relaxed culture, important product, growth is dependent on youEntry level daily work, repetitive tasksGrowing pains but lots of opportunitiesI was one of my manager's first direct reports, so I initially had issues with not having clear direction and not feeling heard. However, things have improved lately and I'm getting the support I need to succeed in my role. The general concensus is that everyone in the company is stretched thin and starting to burn out. We're hiring as fast as we can, but it comes at a cost (large hiring classes that impact quality of training, new leadership like my manager, etc). Tandem does a great job of giving opportunities to those who seek them and helping them grow professionally. Pay is pretty low for entry-level positions. There's plenty of overtime available for those who want it.. Overall, this company is great to get your foot through the door and gain experience.Generous benefits package, solid company culture, lots of opportunitiesHeavy workload, low payIf you enjoy being busy but undervaluedBeware of working anywhere in the production / manufacturing side of tandem. It can be fun working with the employees but management are not ashamed of showing favoritism here, and if they are understaffed they will overwork their team, they refuse to listen to the people who actually work on their line, and would rather produce low quality product and save money than to resolve ongoing issues and cause you emotional distress or conflict if you simply try to bring up a suggestion to improve something. Also, forget “growing” with the company if management finds a flaw in you. They hire diverse cultures but definitely treat some better than others. Yes, they will buy you $10-20 meals IF you meet their unreasonable quotas, & have a drink machine available, but instead they could use $ bonuses as an actual incentive to the workers. Unhappy employees with higher demand will produce lesser quality products.Paid lunches, vending machines, cool employeesManagement does not listen or care about you. Favoritism, high demands, hard to advanceaccepting fun environmentCan be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help.2Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us.Productive but management could be better.If you were as an assembler, you can imagine that it is what you'll be doing all day. But luckily enough, you're constantly surrounded by people. If they're nice, you can make friends easy and talk because what else can you do while you're sitting down for 10/12 hours. However, management can better. There's obvious favoritism and some of them don't know what they're doing. Sometimes there's free lunches that the higher ups provide.Sometimes Free lunches, Work only 4 or 3 days of the week, Vending Machines/Soda Machine, Coffee MakerManagement, People2We appreciate your review. This will be documented with our Human Resources team so that this can be taken into consideration. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.Nice coworkers, pay rate is a little low, nice work schedule (weekend-3 12 hr shifts)Pros: Job is relatively easy, free lunch when quota is met, free drinks, nice coworkers and good teamwork, good weekend schedule (3 12-hr shifts)Cons: lower pay rate compared to other companies1Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We appreciate your work with our team and wish you all the best on your next endeavors!Good Company Bad managementCompany is over all good, pay is okay, 2nd shift supervisor doesn't know what he is talking about. He is very unprofessional and talks bad about every employee. Many have been to HR he continues to be the same so if you are looking to work here Just DO NOT go to 2nd shift (Manufacturing) over all pretty good benefits and easy workBenefits, ScheduleYou have to put up with a bas supervisor just to keep your jobVery productive and great atmosphereThis company is truly the best company I've ever worked for. The culture is beyond comparable to anything I've ever encountered. This company thrives in the products and customer service it provides. Family is definitely what I would consider the feeling this company brings in comfort level. The environment is casual, and outgoing. I was definitely very proud in telling everyone I worked for this company. The best benefits I have ever had, incentives are nice and if you work hard and exceed expectations, the sky is the limit with growth.Free lunches, annual bonuses for all employees, casual setting, work from home, great management teams, amazing benefits.I think the only con I experienced was the training when transferred to a different department.The workload is extreme so they are demanding unrealistic overtimeIt is disappointing to work for a company with a great product, but they are growing so fast and making so much money they are not hiring enough employees to handle the work load. The salaried pay is fair, but when you work overtime (working for free) everyday that brings your salary compensation down.They have a great new facilities in Boise, IDaho, due to covid no one is there.they are using overtime as a tool to get the influx of excessive work done, huge burnoutTerribleDo not work with you on scheduling. Make you choose 4 schedules you would like and you get none of them..they are hard up when it comes to time off. And don't belive in a work life balance.Awesome company!The Customer Sales Support department has really blown up, and they’re constantly creating new positions, both management and support. I really feel like there’s is so much room from growth and advancement within the company. Being in office was great, and they have worked so hard to really create the awesome company culture over teams. Recommend working here.Awesome people, free lunch, opportunityCustomer Technical SupportThis job is a call center job though they might advertise otherwise. Management is none existent to answer any questions in a timely manner. They track you call times. You have to report to your supervisor if you need to take a break ie use the restroom. You are taking calls all day. You get two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. You are just another body to management. Most positions you go through recruiting companies because they go through so many employees.Pay is decent (16hr)Short breaks, watch your every minute move, low job satisfaction, low moralDecent work life balane.Good company to work for. the management treats you well but the job is very repetitive, I worked at the CTS role and most of the work was very repetitive.Pay, Work LifeunrewardingEasy work, good pay, kinda boringOnce you understand the types of calls coming in, its pretty easy and routine. Pay is relatively good, not a high stress job, but can be tiring due to repetitive nature.Kind people, Sometimes theres food, good facilitiesRepetitive nature of workA fun workplace because people treat me like a family and with respectOverall good fixed schedule that works for me.

When something happen, they don't investigate fully and or have fairness. They'll fire you for speaking the truth and to shut you up only. Their not in compliance. Nobody follows WI. I'm glad to not be working their anymore.Poor ManagementThe only that matters at Tandem is whether or not you meet the quiota. I've seen people get let go over the smallest of things yet others are still employed over causing big problems. The supervisors don't care about you no matter how nice they seem.A great place to workThe team at Tandem was a fun group to work for. Everyone was enthusiastic and worked hard for the good of the community. Everyone is super friendly and collaborative.Free soda's, proximity to lunch dining.Difficulty to get to during the rain.Very LiberalVery sensitive and do not speak to you before hand about issues that occur. Very passive aggressive and do not go through a fair process of investigating issues when they do occur. It became apparent that if you were not on a managers good side or if they did not like you that they would rid of you. They seem to care more about getting along with everyone as opposed to doing your job correctly and showing up on time.Very Prodcutive workplaceAlways supportive of their employees.They value employees input.Customers are prioritizedEmployees are prioritizedThey take pride in what they do.accepting fun environmentCan be boring and repetitive at times.

Machines make the parts and the operators assemble them. Each station has specific task for the parts to be completely ready to deliver to people11Chaos with a frat boy cultureManagement is so lost in their own chaos they can’t see straight. They throw money at the chaos thinking more money/employees is the solutions when management needs to MANGE the staff on hand and the poor processes they put in place. Hamster wheel is what it was like to work there.Free drinksLack of management2FairVery strict environment, clinical wise. Had to focus 100% because I was on the inspection area. Rotation was needed so other operator can take their break which gave me the opportunity to work on different machinesNoneIt was great at first year of me working there I get along with most of my co worker, leads,manager and supervisor.

I was originally suppose to work monday - friday and got stuck working graveyard shift for months which they rotate a lot of their new hires into.

Good product and exciting industry. Don’t have a huge amount to say but require 150 characters.Good Work EnvironmentYou trained to work a station and after a few weeks your certified in that area. You can move around to learn other stations so the job doesnt feel very repetitive.Repetitive work but funIt’s fun when working as long as you keep your hands moving and make numbers. Coworkers nice, lots of laughs. A bit loud in room and constant beeping.Nice place to work, but plan on living there more than at home.Always provided plenty of free food.Worked way too much overtime.Management was not always clear with directives. Things would just pop up all of the sudden.Stressful place to workworking in tandem was okay before but getting new people and supervisor was different story, firing people with out any warnings and if the supervisor doesnt like you that means your fires automaticshort breaks, firing people with no warningInnovative ProductThe product was life-changing for diabetics. The company followed their mission which is to lessen the burden on patients suffering from diabetes. I worked in the Philadelphia area calling on Endocrinologists, Diabetes Clinics and CDEs.Work Hard/Play Hard while wearing jeans every dayAlthough the company was too small for my career advancement, I thoroughly enjoyed working here. Culture was beginning to lean toward long hours, but I had a great balance.Casual dress, benefitsLower than average salariesA typical day at TandemYou put on your clean suit and before you head in the clean room, you sanitize your hands with hand sanitizer. You go to your assign station and do your work according to the Work instructions and SOP's.Pure chaosHigh turn over rate at a very stressful work environment with almost no benefits. Very little guidance from managers, poor department planning. Does not do enough to support the Customer Technical Support team.Short Breaks, No PTO, Outdated Inefficient documentation systemWork culture is funmy department (cartridge) is poor on how they manage their people When i was new I was never told to read their work instructions but work right away.Work cultureManagementGreat compensation and benefits, but extremely long working hoursThe company culture, benefits and salary were great, but we worked extremely long hours. There were times when I left the office by 7 p.m. and was required to log in from home until 11 p.m. or 12 a.m. in the morning due to the lack of organization of workflow of middle management, to complete work. It got so bad to the point that the company has an action class lawsuit from previous employees regarding compensation vs. hours worked. Overall is a great company and I have heard not all departments were like mine.Great salary and benefits, awesome company cultureExtremely long working hoursProductive, relaxed, agile work environmentRelaxed culture a lot of PTOOverall, management of R&D is not the best, but the Chief Scientist has great leadership skills.Causal dress attireMajority of the people are friendlyGrowing companyNo considerationNo consideration for injured temporary employees. Hired for 2.5 months then got laid-off due to complained injury. No room for improvement and not a team-work player environment.None.politics and no considerationGreat work environmentI thoroughly enjoy working for Tandem Diabetes care. The management team really wants you to excel in your career and my co-workers are really great to work with."

Bayer,"Productive and easy way to earn moneyEasy job if you do not mind being outside for six or 7 hours a day in the heat. Easy to learn because it becomes repetitive, you do the same thing everyday.1PROS: Hybrid/WFH flexibility, Benefits/Insurance. Coworkers. CONS: Work/Life Balance (depending on dept.), Top-Level ManagementPROS: Depending on the depart you worked in and your position, most employees in my department had the ability to Work from Home a few days a week or when needed. During Covid time, all office workers were required to work from home full-time. The Benefits and Insurance were good. Vacation/PTO was good (if you could take them without having to work during your Vacation time off). Good coworkers and team camaraderie (depending on the department you worked in).CONS: Work/Life Balance, Top-Level Managementsicuramente un ambiente lavorativo molto stimolante ma molto esigentela parte piu' difficile del lavoro e' stata nello svolgere alcune mansioni con personale poco preparatoIl lavoro in se molto gratificante anche se livelli di stress molto altiawesome place to work, with great colleagues and key, insightful learningsseeing to customer needs and following up to meet clients satisfaction. Learnt that the staff are as important as the customer, both parties need to happy for growth to be achieved. Great man management skills and a great work place culture of creating a clean and safe environment where people work, live and play. Following up on distributor order and seeing my yearly forecast/target pull through is the hardest trying to convince the distributor to do more and the most enjoyable if it is achieved.1 starWhat is the best part of working at the company?May/might pay for continuing education.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Expected to work 24/7What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Nice if you are a white male.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Management changes your mind and your goals frequently.Okay Company Needs ImprovementAlthough managers and some coworkers were friendly and supportive, the company culture is dreadful. Compared to other corporate spaces I’ve worked in, Bayer was definitely at the bottom in terms of employee incentives, community outreach, training programs/workshops, and overall culture. Pay was okay if you negotiated upon getting hired. Growth is very limited unless you want to play favorites. I guess it’s an okay company to kick-off your career, I’m glad to be moving on.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?The people who work there are awesome.

Overall a great place to work.Fun and competitiveYou can also describe a motivating company culture by calling it “exciting,” “activating,” or “driven.” Engaging: Suggests that employees will feel invested in their work because it speaks to their interests. You can also say the culture is “enriching,” “stimulating,” or “energizing.A great team but the wider organisation and senior management driving their own agendaI like my role and my immediate teamAnd function but I really do question the wider senior management team who are creating a non Bayer culture which goes against the values of core Bayer. There is limited career progression and it’s more about who you know and not what you know!Lunch card, good benefitsLack of career progression and senior managementProductionVery fast paced. Not for the slow and pokey hard to keep the pace. You got hot and sweaty very fast. Good benefits all right pay. Cry long hoursjob culturegood work environment and nice place to work. They provide enough time to get use to the environment and work. Atleast in the team I worked for. They send me for training to gain additional skills.Amazing company to learn and growI was a year long intern at Bayer, and I learned more with and from the team than my school syllabus. People are really nice and want you to succeed. One thing I loved was team focuses more upon individual's strength over weakness as well as motivate to develop additional skillsets.Company culture, values, Wlb, compensationlesser opportunities for new graduatesExcelente clima laboral y trato.Tuve la oportunidad de trabajar poco tiempo en Bayer Argentina, lamentablemente, pero es un Laboratorio muy recomendable.Great environment for change and constant learningGreat company to work for if you are open to change and learning. Bayer is constantly upgrading processes and deleting or adding new technology. So if you are the type of person who is flexible, your experience has the potential to be fulfilling.Great benefits and compensationManagers are only as good as their training.Good BenefitI like it, the boss is good, the job worth it. I learn a lot from here and I appreciate that, work is interesting and interesting. The work last very longMade 120,000 a yearBayer does not care about work life balance they only care about profit. I found this out the hard way after being forced to work overtime constantly. What they do is refuse to higher additional workers so they rotate overtime. The problem with this method is that it leads to burn out for the entire department. I use to work 7 days in a row each month earning double time each month. On my days off I would be forced to drive an hour or more to work to only be there 4 hours. Also each month I was forced to stay over or come in on a day off to attend meetings or training. Most people are just there for the money not to improve the process or to make a difference.Chef's cooking lunch. Double time.No time to spend with family. Managers who hire their friends.Great teamI had the pleasure of working for Bayer as a temp with great staff and team who make the work place pleasant. Unfortunately I had to move on due to needing extra hours but I would consider working for this company again.Productive and easy way to earn moneyEasy job if you do not mind being outside for six or 7 hours a day in the heat. Easy to learn because it becomes repetitive, you do the same thing everyday.1Stay Away from this placeTerrible work culture there is an few who get special treatment. Everyone else gets stuck with heavy work and the worst schedule. Raises are hard to achieve.Great Work/Life BalanceFour ten hour days really helps create a good work/life balance. The work is interesting enough that the day doesn’t drag either. The only thing I would like to see changed is adding another sick day or two. As of now we’re only allotted 4 for the year, but plenty of vacation daysSupport and flexibility.Insurance is more than awesome and the holidays & vacation time. Their support for a work life balance is strong - they mean it as management walks the talk. You work hard but taken care of.Great insuranceCan’t think of any.Productive and fun workplaceIt has been a great experience working for Bayer in Marana so far! Management is always supportive for career advancement. Safety is a top priority for the entire site. One of the things I really love about working here is that everyone acknowledges when issues occur and they make it a team effort to resolve them.OutstandingWorking at Bayer has been nothing but a positive experience. The management is incredible, my coworkers are fantastic, the benefits can’t be beat, and the environment is clean and up to date. The employees are happy to come to work and also leave with a smile. This has been the best place I’ve worked at my entire working career.All of itNoneManagement is lacking ambitionAs always, too many managers and too many meetings. Training is lacking as well. If you put forth effort it is taken advantage of. Workload gets piled on you.Good company to work for.Good place to work with excellent benefits. Opportunities to learn and grown.Management easy to talk to.You are respected by management and management is open your ideas.Most of your coworkers are real good peopleThe people you work with are good people but the management and Bayer as a whole is a waste of space no use for them treat you like a pawn on chess board. You as an employee means nothing to them you are a number they will replace for no ryme or reasonFree coffeeThe Bayer company (everything)People make this place even greaterStrong and supportive management along with friendly and professional colleagues made me feel like a family member and my days at Bayer interesting journey. Lots of room for improvement and growth.Really good manager!I love my manager! She is very nice and powerful leader in my teams. Really want you to grow and learn new things. She is very helpful and patient. I love to work with her. Most people in Bayer are really nice except several people I met are not welcoming and professional.Great managerRemote, no one cares about your work if they are not in your teamThankless, exhausting place to workThis was a great place to work, about 10 years ago but the work environment has declined in recent years with the Global company outsourcing most of it’s main support staff (IT, Procurement, Accounting) to third parties who lack the skills in their area of expertise, lack communication skills on the rare occasion you can actually find a human to speak to, and lack the personal one on one support of an on-site, employee staffed team.Good pay, disappointing management.The pay is good but not as competitive as it used to be, other companies are starting to come close to Bayer's rates. They offer you 3 weeks of vacation but force you to use a week during their shutdown.Management is the biggest disappointment here, you're just a number and they make that point many times. Between mandatory 60+ hour work weeks with little and sometimes no notice until you arrive that day. If you ask for a break from the overtime supervision will tell you they aren't required to give you any notice and can work you up to 60 hours a week without approval from site leadership. Communication between site leadership and supervision is almost non existent. There's poor planning that leads to unnecessary downtime that you have to make up for over the weekend. The hiring process is 2-3 MONTHS long which leads to lown response rates for offers and people just tired of waiting to hear back from Bayer.Unless you like alot of overtime and being treated like a number stay away from Bayer, they aren't the company the used to be.Not a great environmentThe Myerstown location is like highschool...the popular kids and everyone else. The same individuals get the opportunities and all the temporary work assignments that lead to promotion/raises. Management is very poor and as a result Moral is very poor.Competitive payNice place to work at. It’s really up to you if you want to move up the ladder. Connection is a key component to moving up. You’ll need to watch out for those management that don’t want you to growTypical temp QA jobNothing special, pretty relaxed lab job. Had a good life work balance, would have a few weekends where they needed us to come in. Pay was okay but probably would have been better as a full timerGolden HandcuffsVery good compensation but little opportunity to advance past the base level. Terrible work / life balance with long hours and no schedule flexibility.It’s a good old boy place to work.Management doesn’t communicate with workers. You get told there’s things you can do but that’s not true. Everyone says that they don’t like their job but stayWeekends offBayer: Big company…great people…mgmt is lostBig company with great people but C office is lost. They will continue to outsource IT in a race to the bottom chasing ever lower costs. Everything and everyone is a commodity.Not worth itOverall do not recommend working as a contractor for Bayer in St. Louis. If you are only looking for a temporary contract (2-3 months) and are able to work lots of overtime, it can be an ok gig, depending on what section of the warehouse you are assigned toGood pay and benefitsGood pay, but career advancement as lacking. Senior management is out of touch and treat employees like numbers and not people. This attitude has worked its way down to lower management and supervisors.Pay and benefitsNo work life balance and managent it horribleProductive and easy way to earn moneyEasy job if you do not mind being outside for six or 7 hours a day in the heat. Easy to learn because it becomes repetitive, you do the same thing everyday.1Dynamic and innovative work environmentIf you want to learn about innovative greenhouse operations and problem solve in a developing environment, this is a great location for you. I have already learned a great deal and expect to continue to grow throughout my employment here. As of writing this review, this is not a place to work if you want to show up and complete well-established tasks with limited mental effort. The site has transitioned from startup to operations very recently and the majority of my frustrations have come from the challenges this situation creates. I anticipate that will change as time goes on.Many of the bad reviews for this site are from contract workers, who are justly dissatisfied with their experiences. Having been both contracted and direct hire, they are two different worlds at this company. That being said, this site is on track to transition to majority direct hires and I would expect the ratio of bad:good reviews to shift accordingly.Bayer has excellent benefits and PTO options (for agricultural workers especially), even for people who are recent hires. I am personally getting 4x more PTO here than I did with my last employer. In my role I also have excellent flexibility on my working hours and I can WFH when it is appropriate. The workplace culture is actively inclusive and focused on the mental and physical wellbeing of it's staff. The frank discussion and commitment to safety is impressive.I do have one critical comment, there are elements in the middle management that show clique-behavior and there are certain managers that are not up to the task of management. OverallGood work-life balance, hybrid WHF roles for some roles, optional 4-10 shifts, inclusive and safe culture.Certain managers have non-cooperative behavior, Recent startup can be challenging1Good pay, great atmosphere.I had a great time while working in the Facilities team at Monsanto! They invest in safety culture with training opportunities available. And it is located in Creve Couer!you will never become full time if you are under a contractorloved the scientists and their passion to share the knowledge.Station manager was horrible in management. I Felt belittled and he made work miserable.A good capital investment engineering dept to be a part of.I was a routine mechanical design contractor, on site for 4 years. The department was a strong team of about 10 engineers & 5 designers, dedicated to capital investment construction projects on site.Project pace was always reasonable. I felt like a valued resource and was regularly solicited for my thoughts & opinions as projects developed.The team invested in me & my counterpart by providing training & support for new technologies, like 3D laser scanning and intelligent modeling. This is uncommon in a contractor- industrial client arrangement.I was able to provide the highest quality results possible because I was valued as a team member & treated like a friend.Helpful people willing to explainGreat environment of helping each other succeed. And promotion within. Good managers and co-workers who will help you find answers and respectful to everyone.ManagementRemote workProductive Workplace for MostThis position was very productive during the day, but not so much when working evening shifts. Most technicians stayed very busy during their shifts, but others were not required to do so.Easy going environment outside of busy seasonGreat work environment but work life balance could be better. No real consistency in the position. Training could be more efficient and knowledge about certain processes could be passed to all employees so no confusing arises.Excellent work like balanceExcellent worklife balance at plant. 9/80 schedule, with hybrid work split between 3 days at plant and other days working from home. Pay and benefits could be better.Good for ExperienceGreat experience but low pay. The team I had was great as well as the supervisors but there was not really any room for growth. I do think it was great for connections!It has changed since i leftSupportive direct management.offshored a lot of their work to lower cost countries.Limited opportunities for advancement.Overall I enjoyed working for Bayer, but I believe the culture has changed post Monsanto acquisitiongood pay/ benefitsoutsourcing of employeesNot worth an extended stayThe first year and a half or so was pretty nice all in all. You can advance pretty quickly, provided you show a minimum amount of effort, and even maybe end up in a spot that fits you pretty well. Unfortunately once you start floating up the ranks, and eventually find yourself stuck in one position forever, you start to notice glaring problems that just never get resolved no matter how many times you bring them up. This is largely because the site management either can't prioritize well or just isn't willing to communicate/act on what was communicated as far as in cleanroom issues go. Pay was largely mediocre, raises were frequent but the math came out to more or less enough to break even with inflation each year and not much more if any. End result is a frustrating mess you're paid just a little under needing a roommate to help with a cheap apartment wages and that's just not worth it to me. Benefits and the vast majority of coworkers were nice though.Coworkers, benefits, speed of advancement early onmiddle management communication, mediocre pay, general lack of advancement opportunities after a pointGreat for full timers, not so great for contractorsIf you have the right skills, and have some level of self respect to not accept a contract position (only accept full-time if you know your worth), the sky's the limit for you. Otherwise, go look for something better somewhere else.Great employeesBayer is a great place to work especially if you are looking for a job without a degree. I started there very young and they allowed me to grow and develop in the company.people you work with are greatManagement is low tierGreat place to work with fantastic colleaguesEnjoyed my time and was able to learn and advance with increasing responsibilities. Ability to collaborate across teams domestically and internationally on companywide and department strategic goals.Decent company, horrible co-workersFor the most part, Bayer has been good to work for. The type of work is hazardous and that’s expected in a facility that produces phosphate for fertilizer.So it’s pretty sad to saythe majority of the people working there completely destroy any chance of it being a decent work place. Everyone is worried about the personal lives of others more than anything else. And heaven forbid you have surgery for anything and aren’t at work. I have never experienced the negativity and conniving behavior that I’ve seen at Bayer. Being able to trust people you work with is huge but they make it impossible.Ok company to start your careerGood place to start your career . Managers are helpful and the job is ok, not very stressful. Pay is low so take advantage of what you can learn and then leave.Lab TechnicianThe work was pretty easy and straightforward. I worked as a contract. They seem to not care about the contractors much, but more care goes to the FTEs.A plethora of vending machines.They have a large selection of vending machines; like Japan has. There are vending machines for candy, chips, sandwiches, soup, gum, coffee, pizza, and ice cream. These types of amenities go a long way when you're working all day. Keep it up with the cool and modern vending machines.Summer InternIt was a project-based internship. The project provided a real-world Machine Learning experience to me as a student. I also had meetings with my mentor every week.To many managers who often have no idea what's going on.Most of my coworkers were great,management seemed to favor young college employees over some older hard workers. Temp workers not treated fairly. The one good Manager was forced to retire."
"Sandhills Global, Inc.","Good WLB. Terrible culture.Will never have to work later than your scheduled hours. However, raises are few and far between. Required to be in office and wear a suit (seriously). Very old school style of running a company. Turnover is high.4College InternI worked at Sandhills Global as a college intern. I was making $15/hr and 20% commission on all sales, which was pretty good money while still being in college. I believe once you are hired the base salary is $40k/year, but that might have changed in the last few years. While I worked there I was required to wear skirts/dresses/tights/ballet flats, which might have been updated since then, but it was awful that it was enforced for so long. I did not feel supported by my managers, when we did monthly reviews they offered no help. They handled COVID-19 poorly in my eyes, we were sent home for a few weeks and then were pressured to return to the office when we were fully capable of doing our jobs at home. Most of the interns in my department were laid off with no notice, including myself. They were extremely intense with micro-managing. One of the biggest perks was they gave out free husker tickets for home games during football season.Nice snack bar/cafeteria, pay, benefits, etc.Dress code, in office requirement, micro-managing3Pretty goodPay is flat, expect a high volume call center environment. Managers feel like they barely care most of the time. Open floor seating and very lax on COVID protocols.11Good placeIt was an interesting place to work. Lots of things going on. Management didn’t seem to be very supportive. Was overall impressed with work line balance.Great companyGreat company to work for, family owned and operated. Wonderful with scheduling and time off. Very helpful when training very responsive in management. Highly recommendedFlexible Schedulebut never able to take vacation without making up the hours. Overall great job, but sometimes you just need a break without worrying about getting in your weekly hours.Flexible Schedule, Generous perksNo way to take off ""vacation"" time, without making up your hoursI wouldn’t recommendThis job is convenient to those who need to work from home but they make you work just under full time hours so they don’t have to pay benefits for you.PoorPoor environment and pay, little support and chance for advancement. Not a lot of training or background on the purpose of job. Unsure of dress code of why you have to wear a suit and tie to sit and enter data at computer all day with no interaction with anyone.Easy work.PlentyLook out for favoritismI recently had to leave Sandhills and all I can say is I'm so happy that I made that decision. Unnecessary write ups, no room for advancement, unless you are the teachers pet. I WORKED HARD at this place for 4 yrs with only ONE raise. You feel like you aren't appreciated. I feel like I wasted 4 yrs of my life there. Our department manager most definitely showed favoritism to a select few of my peers who would mess up alot, even on the most simplistic things.Christmas bonusNo room for advancementGives good experience for individuals just starting out. I would never recommend staying on full-time though.If you’re in college it’s an easy job to have, but I would never recommend staying on full-time. Company culture is a miss and management is questionable.Good place to work in collegeThis is a great place to intern while in college because you get great experience and the pay is fantastic. My career goals took my to a different career path but I would have loved to start here if I wanted to stay in sales/business world.pay, open environment, good managementdress codeGood internship for college studentsWhile it was a stressful job sometimes, Sandhills really does pay well especially for internships for college students. Management however is very strict, but they’re told by the higher ups. If you can sell, they’ll love you. If you’re not the greatest, you won’t succeed.Pay and commissionNo work/life balance, managementNice Place, jobs have their pro's and consI really enjoy working here. It is low stress, managers are supportive and I've learned a good amount since I started here. The only problem is their offices which are extremely nice are not conducive for a productive team environment. You don't really need a team though since typically all work is done by yourself and you get a few projects here or there with someone else. I went a week without having a reason to speak to anyone face to faceEasy, supportive managersReally easy to be complacent, not a lot of room for advancementGood place to put on a resume but not work at long termConstant change of priorities leave sales teams in limbo as to what squeaky wheel gets the grease this week. CEO operates with a sense of entitlement and comes across as arrogant and unapproachable to most employees outside of his circle. Constant turnover along with long time employees leaving causes morale issues. It’s a great place to start out career wise but set your sights higher long term.Free Huskers Football tickets for employeesOutdated dress code, micromanagementWorst company I have ever worked forWhen I accepted the job at Sandhills I was extremely excited to start. It did not take long for me to realize that this was not a great company to work for. They promote their open floor plan as a positive thing, so that you can get to know your coworkers better, but really it is so managers can look over your shoulder at anytime to see what you are doing. They have a task order system, in which EVERYTHING gets sent to your manager for review before you can complete any task. Even asking for office supplies has to be approved by a manager before you can receive it.Honestly the environment is just miserable. When you work for a company 5 days a week, 40 hours a week, you want to feel comfortable. This is NOT the case at Sandhills. I can in with a few years of experience and thought I was pretty good at my job, but after working for Sandhills for a year, I had never felt more incompetent in my ability to do my job. It was until I left sandhills and started working for my current company that I finally felt like I had a voice, and knew what I was doing.The dress code sucks, but it is honestly the least of your worries there. Managers will NEVER come up and talk to you straight to your face, instead they just send you an extremely passive email.Honestly, I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. No one should ever have to go through what this company puts you through. They decide within the first week if they are going to like you or not, and if they don't, LOOK out, because you are in for a rough experience. You will never have to worry about getting fired,They won't terminate you, because they are so scared they will get sued, but they will make your work life so awful that you will have no other option but to leave.Good company to work for. Pay was decent benefits were not the best though. Lots of different areas of company to work in.Work-life balanceWork life baPay & benefitsThe pay at Sandhills Global was good but the benefits were bad insurance was high and no company match.Alright place to workthey have some good things like good pay and give you the ability to work hard and make some money. Have some good training for new people coming into sales as well.N/a- No cubical, big open “desk” seating.- Lots of perks: community and benefits- Compensation.- Work/ balance.- Really no room for advancement.- Numbers business, that’s weird for designers.Good Product, Bad managementThe best thing I can say for Sandhills is their line of products. They offer a wide variety and are effective in the industry, making it a good product to sell. You generally leave right at 5:00 as well, outside of travel, making work life balance a positive at Sandhills.The negatives mostly stem from upper management, specifically the CEO. Unprofessional and often threatening emails are regularly sent company wide calling out individual performances. Negative reinforcement is common and positive reinforcement is rare and usually inorganic. This is also usually the only method of letting you know if you're doing well or not at the company, as proper reviews and expectations are not given at Sandhills.Middle Management are generally easy to work with, though not without fault as well. There is a lack of communication between middle management and their departments as well as a lack of set expectations. As mentioned above, there are no monthly or quarterly reviews and yearly reviews usually involve only a cursory glance of the past year and vague plans for the next FY with no fiscal goals set.Compensation is varied depending on which department and territory you work. Average compensation is acceptable for entry level sales. However there is no 401K match and vacation is minimal. The company does (usually) give out a nice Christmas bonus to all employees, but no bonuses based on sales.In summation, I would say it weren't for the CEO then the company would be a pleasant place to work. If you're just starting out in sales this can be a positive step in that direction.Worklife balance, ProductsNo 401K Match, Poor upper managementStrict and Stressful EnvironmentThe environment is very formal. There is not a lot of collaboration with other members. Training is an informational overload and it was hard to get answers to questions.Job that pays well with room for advancementManagers don't seem to look out for your best interest. Their motivation is to embarrass employees rather than reward good deeds. Culture is terrible.Good WLB. Terrible culture.Will never have to work later than your scheduled hours. However, raises are few and far between. Required to be in office and wear a suit (seriously). Very old school style of running a company. Turnover is high.4Decent work environmentSandhills does not offer any job advancement, however, for steady pay it's a decent job. You dont make enough for the cost of living but you get 401k, some health, dental, and vision.2Constantly growing companyI enjoy my position and what I do. Workload isn’t overwhelming but can be stressful at times. My biggest complaint there is no feedback on job performance for new employees, and no set time frame for raises or work evaluations to let employees know if they are meeting expectations. There is no stated probation period. Most co-workers are friendly. The dress code is professional; suites, white shirts and tie, dresses and pantyhose.Flexible hrsLong periods of sittingFun productive placeGreat place to work. Very easy going in our department. Liked the professionalism of the office and its employees, but still able to have fun. Good, supportive supervisors who want you to succeed.Professional environment, good boss and co-workersIf you don't like business professional, you won't like it thereNot a great place to workFor the most part, days give the appearance of autonomy, but they're not that great. Often put on ""projects"" to generate ""leads"" that are never contacted by the sales team. No incentives to perform in the office. Sales team treated like Gods, marketing team treated like hobos. Management only cares about results, not the people creating the results. Slim to none when it comes to career advancement opportunities. ONLY positive about the job is the annual bonus based on number of days you travel, and that you occasionally get to travel somewhere interesting.Annual BonusPoor management, boring work, treated like an object.Not a place you want to workIf you like being treated like garbage and talked down to, this is the place for you. If you like call campaigns to try and make sales for products you don't receive commission on, this is the place for youAwesome place to work forI worked with Sandhills for one year and a half. My manager was great and my peers were very helpful. They care about their people and their development.MercadotecniaUna empresa que está en alto crecimiento, excelente personas.Management was poorManagement didn't have a clue on day to day functions of my role.

If you love to travel this is the job for you! This company is at the top of the industry and will help you succeed.Best Sales Internship EverCan honestly say Sandhills Publishing offers the best internship possible for a college student. The internship has a great hourly wage with uncapped commission potential, and gives intern the experience needed to do anything they want upon graduation. Interns set their own schedule, are given a tablet and iPhone, and have the opportunity to make $40-$50 an hour consistently. Interns just moved into a brand new state-of-the-art building, and upon graduation always have the ability to open the conversation into full-time opportunities. Intern management can feel very micro-managed (I've received the same email 5 times within an hour from different levels of management), and if they want their hand in on what you are doing, they definitely will. Strict white shirt & tie dress code, no exceptions. Very hard focus on the bottom line. Opportunity for travel even as a student. Culture is the part to be most improved on...often the feel is full-time reps and even interns dislike their jobs and are only their for money. Great opportunity to make as much money as you want, without having to call and sell to people in your private life (like Northwestern Mutual). Overall, extremely great internship and can't be thankful enough for finding it.Friendly work place not too difficultWork from 7-4 every day of the week. Not expected to work more or less.Work place is fine, not too much pressure as a developer to get stuff done. Management is fine, they understand you have school. Hardest part is learning the code base. The culture is decent people are friendly and easy to get along with.ReviewFast paced. Great people. Just don't agree with everything that goes on there. Lots of travel which was good for me. Not enough room for advancement. Waiting for someone to quit to advance.Terrible CultureGood job experience when you first get out of college but do NOT stick around, no opportunity for growth and terrible workplace culture. Managers are arrogant and ignorant.Sandhills PublishingTypical day at work will involve sales calls, work trips, and meetings throughout the week. Very rewarding career if your sales oriented. Sky is also the limit for compensation. Very rewarding company if you want to work hard.Solid employer to build experience in sales as an intern.They have a good intern program where they show you several facets of the business and train you to be an effective sales rep. The pay is generous for a college student but bureaucracy and favoritism prevent advancement.Good WLB. Terrible culture.Will never have to work later than your scheduled hours. However, raises are few and far between. Required to be in office and wear a suit (seriously). Very old school style of running a company. Turnover is high.4Growth Opportunities and Professional CultureI sincerely appreciate the professionalism of the company and the work mentality. At Sandhills I have opportunities to prove myself through the work that I do on a daily basis and know that I can continue to grow as a professional.The fast paced environment gives you the opportunity to learn in an exciting environment that evolves within the industries you work in.I definitely recommend to those who are looking to progress and find a competitive, well paid, professional environment.Competitive Pay, Professional Environment, Opportunities for growth, Benefits710Productive workplace with some amazing coworkersYou learn alot in this very open workplace environment. The people made the job and the environment fun and exciting. Depending on the manager, the management was relaxed enough to give you space. Some managers liked to micromanage constantly, making the job seem more tedious.vacation days as soon as you startno 401k172Good Product/Bad ManagementThey have developed a great product but their management is terrible.

Hard to find a better opportunity in the area.Rewarding payRigid enviromentStressful working environment with little leadership but high rewardsTravelled 60-70 days a year visiting current customers and locating new leads. Working with both print and web medium. Management provides little guidance besides negative reinforcement. The hardest part is the initial sale, after that it was good repeat business. It was also very difficult to get payment from customers and if they went bad debt that comes out of my pocket.Potential high payHigh stress and travelGood payGot to travel a lot to meet with clients.

They were really friendly and helpful. Netflix is extremely goodNetflix is a world wide company. They are friendly and kind they have good customer base. I can manage my time because Netflix give us good and time managing tasks . I have completed my task at time. Netflix paid my salaries at time. If I have a chance to work on Netflix again. It will be a great opportunity to me because Netflix is really kind and friendly they helped us. Netflix is extremely good. I'm happy with Netflix.Sometimes good sometimes badAlways had contests to make the work environment a great place to work. I do not know if the stressful calls without much help for management is worth sticking around for the contests. Seems like there is always a shift bid going on and the available shifts change dramatically within each 3 month period. This makes it hard for people with kids. You may get a 6am to 2pm shift one time and then company will get rid of that shift all together and depending on where you are in seniority or stats yuh could end up with a 4pm to midnight shift. You just never know.Horrible ManagementEven with 9+ years of experience in my field, I was micromanaged to death! Disgusting lack of trust and inherent fear amongst teammates.

I finally felt like I had found a stable job with reasonable pay and benefits that I could work at forever and work my way up. I felt such pride working for this company and that was a huge deal for me. I wanted to work somewhere brag worthy, and that call center was it. I loved literally everyone I worked with. I'm not sure I'll ever feel as satisfied working any other job and I wish daily they didn't outsource all their call centers and shut us down. It's been years and I still miss that job.FunplaceIt was really good and easy going job but then the campaign was sold and they had to let us go but it was one of the best jobs I have ever had and I will love to be backFree lunchesShort breakJust terribleMy 3 years there were the 3 worst years of my working life. It was an awful experience working with a company bloated with too many inept managers. I was ultimately let go for reading a gardening book at my desk between calls, a rule that was never written down and none of my colleagues had heard spoken. They were a bunch of no talent clowns.Productive and fun place to work at, they are very respectful and everyone gets along, no drama. Excellent work ethics, my favorite job of my life!Everything at Netflix is wonderful. Great!! I love it there. Change is good and I'm only part time now so I'm looking for a full time job and it I have been there for 7 years, it is time to explore other options.Tense and stressful workplaceJudging by the questions, I’m assuming this doesn’t have to do with working on set for Netflix. All I can say is, out of the couple times I ended up working for Netflix, specifically the last time: the management was the worst out of any job I’ve ever worked. The policies were absolutely ludicrous to the point where changes had to be made urgently in the middle of the project. I wouldn’t care if they knew who wrote this.Guaranteed long workShort breaks, no breaks, awful bosses, disrespect is a norm.Dream job while you're usefulDisclaimer: I was laid off as part of a reorganization (1 of 10), but I would have written the same review had I been the one who was spared. In the 5+ years that I worked at NF, 4 first years were awesome. I often felt elated, I loved going to work both physically and then virtually due to COVID. Mature, caring colleagues, interesting work, lots of learning, wonderful connections. I joined when my team was in the startup phase, and it was the best time for ideas and trying new things with no budget limitations. Gradually, over the course of the following 5 years, the need to scale led to constant changes, both of leadership and workflows. Team leaders were being ""let go"" on average every 1.5 years if not sooner. There was barely enough time to become good at what one does as yet another big reorg/title change would come around. Lastly, the team came under the leadership of people who had absolutely no knowledge of the team's specialty, but were ""experts"" in strategizing and optimizing processes.Eventually it shifted from being people-driven to process-driven, from collegial to top-down. The bottom line started winning over quality while business needs outweighed everything else.Pros:Awesome colleaguesProductive work environmentTop of market pay, nice perksLots of learning opportunities through constant changeCons:Low job securityProcess driven vs people drivenConstant changeHigh level of ambiguityGreat employer. Nice pay. Cool culture. Genuine.Long hours. Great people. No drama.The people were really nice and the company did not really spare any expense to strive to make a movie of a high caliber.Generally a decent place but turnover is high and work appreciation is lowI initially enjoyed working here but I noticed that sometimes you’re not appreciated for the work that you do well and, instead, you’re criticized for what you may not do well. Scheduling and calendar management are major for assistants but they’ll also throw project work on you which is what a coordinator should be doing - not an admin.goodGood work life balance, understanding managers, strong culture. Bennefits package is good too. People are nice and friendly, very international. Growing inside the company might be challenging.3The over emphasis on DEI is maddeningTheir entire company is modeled around 1 percent of the populationJob security is zero. Once your contract is up you need to re-apply to work on another project.Constant emphasis on inclusion and diversity makes it feel like that is the only reason the company exist.And if you don’t agree, of course, you are not included.Best swag everNo job security.3Sounds great from the outside, totally different on the insideBe ready to be worked into the dirt. There's no such thing as a work-life balance here.Managers protect each other and act counter to the company culture, then gaslight you by saying you're misinterpreting the culture.Politics is the only way to get ahead and be ready to be passed up for promotions or more responsibilities by those who play the game better, even if their work is terrible.Lunches and snacks, nice name to put on your resume, good pay.Mental Health will nosedive, rest of your life will suffer.5Yoga balls are slippery and we need more catered food with fruits and vegetables, imported and poached correctly.I really liked working with everyone in a diverse work setting.

The pay was satisfying, and there were little to no cons! However, as I started overachieving at work, I never got a raise! That is why I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5.Best companyThis was one of if not the best company I’ve worked for. The culture the people just the overall vibe was awesome. I definitely would recommend working here.Good incomeReally good pay. Pretty easy but incoming calls can be nonstop at certain times. Down time is fun because you can play group games or mess around with different consolesMoneyBack to back callsOne of the Best Places to workHappy kind positive amazing place to work. I was able to come to work and find out what my skills were and I will always be appreciative of Netflix for that! Thank you for helping me realize a workplace can be and should be better!! You are amazing I’m sad you left Salt Lake! 😔buenomuy bueno el ambiente laboral con los compañeros y ayudaGood but badThey offered a high salary. The working environment was good, however there was a culture of fear which everyone was talking about. Seeing my mates getting fired often, I found out I'm working in a place where my space was not secured.Basic Call CenterNot a great place to work. Expectations were high, morale was low. Nearly unreachable goals and management was just the guy who sat next to you who had the best call times.Best place I have ever workedThe DVD.com hub I worked at was wonderful, very few employees, very laid-back atmosphere, but highly efficient and productive, encouraging self-motivation. If you wanted to learn more positions, you could, if you were content with the same tasks then you could didn't have to learn new ones. They paid very well for the work, offered paid time off, retirement and really great monthly gifts even for part time employees!The work itself is fairly monotonous, usually just loading and unloading DVD's and troubleshooting jams in the machinery, but what warehouse isn't monotonous. The flexibility to learn more positions allows a person to take on the level of challenge they are feeling up to that day.Pay, benefits, cultureNot the best working environmentEnvironment was unprofessional. They didn’t pay well. Training was decent. Room for growth to becoming a leader or tier 2 representative. Contract eventually expired.High salary, no growth, selfish management.You’ll never be paid more for a job as they pay top of market and definitely mean it. There’s a heavy amount of nepotism and friend hook ups happening at the company. If you have a disagreement or run in with a manager your chances of survival are nearly none. Netflix is the Las Vegas of jobs, gambling high risk high reward against a potential huge let down should you get on someone’s bad side. There’s virtually no growth in the company anymore as things are too corporate. Don’t believe the legends of people starting out as assistants and becoming Vice Presidents. That doesn’t happen there anymore, it’s become just another top heavy corporation. Great salary, little future, zero security.Salary, Healthcare, StockZero work/life balance, terrible middle management, no growth opportunitiesCultureIt is unlike any place that i have worked. It is challenging work, but rewarded with a generous (top of market) salary, and an unparallelled benefits package. Usually with full health, 401k and stock options.Netflix RulesI had the best time working at Netflix. Although my position was short lived because I had other jobs, I saw room for growth within the company and I the teams. It was great being able to get a account with Netflix and seeing all the programs coming out. Helping customers is a plus!! Great job for the pay too! $15 and up!!Free food on special days, games, fun teamworkShort bathroom and lunch breaks.Company had a bad systemAll Netflix cared about was getting the customer off the phone in 7 minutes or less. All they wanted you to do was send them the emails in the support page and hang up. If your average call time was above seven minutes you had to go into coaching. The more calls the more money and less helping people. Job tookcl years off my life from the stress of working 5 to 2am.None reallyEverythingHad betterHad better jobs. Laid off due to pandemic. Worked me 5 days a week even being part time. Volume dropped tremendously.

Otherwise, I’d still be working there.Free breakfast… Sodas, CandyOur department moved to another state!MonotonousIt's just a typical call center.

I felt like they had decent leadership as well. I would recommend working there to one of my colleaguesInclusivity RestructuredI specifically left a good job w/ managers I actually trusted, to come work for Netflix because of the culture they advertised. I eventually learned the culture did not apply to me, as explained by HR. The HR Business Partner was completely ineffective & only went out of their way conceal concerns I had. Once I began to speak up, I was retaliated against.The culture is lip service and is not practiced in the work environment. If it is, exceptions have been made and the culture does not apply to everyone. There is most definitely a ""culture of fear"" & I unfortunately witnessed it firsthand.These were some of the slimiest managers & producers I've ever had the displeasure of working with, they possess the morals of guinea pigs.There was also tampering with my payroll information & incorrect information purposely placed in my records.There is a culture that is advertised & sharedThat culture is no longer in place & does not apply to everyoneHorrible management team.Great people can be found however the toxic environment usually pushes the good ones away fast. I have never written one of these but run away from this place...don't walk. Promises are frequent but management is brutal. I have been in management for 20 years and never seen anything this bad.Free mac and cheeseEnvironment, culture, managementFun place to work, typical customer service job.Management changes up every six months, they coached us every week. But the customers were usually pretty nice. You'd get the usual entitled customer who'd be very demanding as to why their netflix didn't work. But what do you expect.Swag, cool break roomNo room for growthExcellent leadershipThe leadership there is incredible and they want you to succeed. The job itself is really simple but does require a lot of patience. There's room to grow and your supervisors will help you to succeed.

I had to deal with 2 trainers neither knowing how to do the job they are training you for. Most questions are always ignored as your told to look it up. Often times if you struggle or need any explanation during training you will get ignored completely. Half the time you are working if you need a supervisor or lead to assist in a case you'll end up waiting 20 minutes just to get a response. They fired me because I left work halfway through the day after clearly showing I was too ill to perform my duties that day. Because half a day is more important than my health. never work for this company they do not care about you and will drop you like a fly the moment you aren't a top performing model employee with near perfect health and immunity to all disease.El ambiente de trabajoEl trabajo parece fácil , pero llega hacer monótono todo s los dias laborales son exactamente iguales, llega hacer muy monótono.Buen seguro médico, vacaciones, sueldoDías de 4 horas laborales contra otros de hasta 12 horasProductive fun work place enviormentI love my job here its so much fun and everyone is so nice and talented everyone helps out amd communicates very well.

Nelnet,"Great place to workI worked in the TPD call center for a year and honestly, it wasn't the best. It was high stress and overall I'd give it a 1 star. I then transferred to Enrollment Processing and I loved everything about that job.Work from homeGreat company to work for supervisor is great and team leads very helpful willing to work with you if you need help or have emergency where you need to leaveBest remote job yetAa long as you retain your training and can adapt well to changes you can thrive here. Super welcoming. Hard to fail If you communicate with your team.Fun and helpfulAll trainers and supervisors are super nice and helpful. Hours are good as well as pay rate is great. Would recommend for anyone who wants to work remote.Easy and good jobI liked this job a lot, but at the time it was Covid forbearance and it was a lot of just waiting for the phones to ring. It was a good job but I didn’t like the late hours. I did enjoy being at home I just wish I had been healthy enough to stay on. Overall, the company is really attentive to your needs and makes sure you have the trainings you need to do the job.Micromanage & bully work environmentOnly boot lickers & brown nosers advance here. They have a high turn over rate for a reason. They are understaffed & underpaid. Constant overtime. Bosses like to talk about their brand new car they bought at the beginning of every year. You are just a number. If something happens to your health or you die… they do not care. They only care that it inconveniences them. Oh yea, lots of pizza parties.Generic pizza & pop & ice creamEverythingSoul crushingIncredibly soul crushing work. Constant micromanaging and being screamed at by customers. Raises based on computer systems that don’t work, extreme tech difficulties and when you reach out to leadership that claim they never received any communication from you. Very poor onboarding classes, you will not be confident when you start taking calls. Unclear rules and quality department constantly makes mistakes and spreads incorrect info but it doesn’t matter if you point out quality was incorrect and you were right becuase it will not be adjusted on your score card, it will still be shown as a negative mark. Very limited room for career growth becuase they hire so many people all the time.Too manager focusedIt's hard to leave an accurate review for such a large company with tons of different divisions. But across the board it seems there's a big focus on manager culture and the art of management, which obviously leads to some serious micromanagement.Starting pay is competitive though raises aren't (that seems to be the norm everywhere now though). Benefits are kind of a mixed bag. Some are good such as 401k matching and student loan repayment assistance, and some are really bad, such as the health insurance.At least in my division they're very flexible with remote work which is very nice.In all it's a great place for a steady corporate job. Maybe not so much though if you're introverted like me and need some breathing room away from the army of managersGood and badA good manager will make whatever position you have positive, and enjoyable. The company culture is fairly welcoming and encouraging. However that can sometimes lead you to feeling like you're stuck in a never ending freshman orientation.Friendly people, good benefits.Unreasonable expectationsVery generous benefitsThey love spoiling their employees. Generous time off, bonuses multiple times through out the year, perks for being healthy. Some calls could get a little complex but there was always someone willing to offer help. Which helped make the remote work a little less lonely. Training was 6 weeks and the information was flowing constantly with a final at the end.DependsNelnet is a good stepping stone for a career . Their pto is generous. They're patient and help you learn and grow . Depending on the department you get promoted to . They will suggest special projects without incentive . Over worked and under paid where other companies have multiple different departments this company has most rolled into one roll .from mandatory outbound calls in a system that lags so bad every 3 calls regardless of internet speed and cleared cache ( worked in office ) the micromanagment when their systems lag . When employees who are mostly happy to do their jobs start complaining about the outbound system because it's frustrating for the customers and us , we received an email from leadership saying ""we are lucky to have our jobs "" it's 2022 ........ The culture can be great , but when they hire supervisors off the street and don't have them on the phones long they develop a complex and the employees are underminded . You are overworked and underpaid . Once you receive a promotion you won't get an annual salary increase since the couch change promotions( .50 cents for being cross trained ) apparently means you're rolling in the dough . The positives are you work and come across some great people , patient people . They do give you room to learn . As for promotions if you want to be demoted and you're good at your job they ignore you and set up a meeting to tell you how good you're doing.... Recently they've been promoting people that don't have enough basic knowledge for their positions . They're promoting to promote . Nelnet has somehow lost their purposeHelping, ptoWe are just a number in their "" right sizing ""Great management and training staffI only have been with Nelnet since Aug 15 2022 as of the date of this review, however I have enjoyed my training working with the teams and so far have had a fun experience. The leads and trainers always make sure to answer your questions and make sure you're prepared for your doing your job.Great teams and culture, good pay and benefits, very helpful trainers and supervisors.No cons with the company, the only things that's frustrating is getting past government clearance to do this job.It’s great & sometimes stressful.Honestly I love my job and much more that we work from home. I wish the time could be a little more flexible as far as like pick up my kiddo from school come back type of thing. Also I love that they care about our mental health since callers can be jerks and they pay for our gym or stress relief things like a massage. I’ve built my mini gym solely on getting a machine per year that is below their amount they give. My sup is pretty great when I said I was applying for another department and they all wished me good luck and everything.Work from home, refunded for gym use.Short breaks, eto onoy if you saved it up.I like my job. You have opportunity for growthNelnet offers a lot of opportunities for growth. The training is pretty easy. The real work is on the floor. Every possible scenario you will be dealing with. Im hands on training was a challenge. Most of my knowledge was learned after training.Very good company but, don't get too attachedThe company is very good. The trainers were very helpful in 7 weeks of training and were with the trainees every step of the way. Nesting was enjoyable and managers never made you feel like you were alone. I will say if they do have a slow period they may fire you if your metrics are not good.Great place to workGreat place to work and grow. Very friendly people, loving, caring, and understanding. Very diversity. You want a great work environment to grow, then Nelnet is a place to beData Entry Specialist“This is a great company to work for. I am pleased that they have high standards for their employees to go by.“Just a reminder that I LOVE THIS COMPANY. THANKS FOR LETTING ME WORK FOR U!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE AWSOME.”goodGood company bad leadershipThis is a good company in Lincoln and gives many people jobs but leadership and management is not on the same page ever. Hard to advance unless you use politics.Excellent company led by executives with strong ethical standardsYou want to work for Nelnet! Management is great, from team leads to top execs. It's a business, it exists to make money, but *not* at any cost -- real time, attention and resources are poured into assuring the well-being of the employees.Great pay but they do not care about employeesThe pay is great it is hard to get a shift bid if you don’t personally know any higher ups.

Overall decent besides the call flow! And reading people’s minds. Still a good stepping stone.Flexibility, home and work balancePay, borrowers2Management is very helpfulWorking here for almost a year, management is very helpful, they understand we as employees have a life outside of work.

One of the best places I've ever worked! Call centers are generally tedious to work at, but it was above the norm at Nelnet.Outstanding benefitsCall centerStressful awful payRaises are little to nothing promotions are handed out like candy to people that don't know what their doing micromanaging has been put unto place because of that. Super stressful work environment higher ups believe throwing a free lunch or a small bonus is equivalent to a competitive pay rate.Health Insurance Dental and VisionPay is horrible raises are little to nothing even bonus is very littleManagement communications lackYou will be teaching yourself a lot of skills, as the managers will know less than the actual workers. I do not know the reason or benefit of this. If you call help desk, help desk will shrug their shoulders and you will be back to juat helping yourself, which causes miscommunication between reps and customers.Work from homeTeaching yourself everything, never getting any answers, managers leaving you on read for days and avoiding answering questionsmanagement was vey childishNo work balance at all in this place, management was very childish, absolutely no room for advancement.The pay is very low and its not worth your mental healthI know this company can do better, but work needed done still.The coworkers are fun and the environment energizing. The supervisors are great. Company pay is low and possibility for advancement not easy to obtain. They don't look at advancing you at all if you are over 50. Company has high expectations. They do work with you to get you up to speed, and it is hard to fail if you really are trying. For what the competition is to the job I would say stress is something could be done more to release the stress by helping with pay and looking at advancing those who ask. They do offer before COVID fun events but not anymore.Data entry workStrong standards which I appreciate.But solely did data entry and the requirements were a bit unrealistic.Benefits were almost worth it. But if being a robot for a giant corporation is your cup of tea then it’s prefect for your.Not what I expectedI wouldn’t even suggest a dog to work here literally . They managers don’t help they don’t know anything and there very unprofessional.I wouldn’t dare go backGreat Place for short periodPrivate student loan side. Benefits are the best I have had, its the reason i have stayed so long. Quarterly HSA paid by the company. Can move positions in 6 months, pay doesn't change with position change. Quarterly bonuses based on performance. Upto 3% merit raise.Benefits, Eto.PayNot worth itYou are underpaid to do everyone’s job and the jon it’s self is really hard and they should pay more than what they offer. No one is ever on the same page. I wouldn’t recommendDecentOkay great benefits they could give more due to the needed line of work but it's okay for now. Trying to explore more avenues in hopes of sticking to this company longer.BenefitsNoneDecent place to work. Great job security. Advancement somewhat questionable.Worked here for 6.5 years. Started at 12.50/hr and left at 19.56/hr. Company culture was excellent. Some of the work was arbitrary during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the student loan freeze. We were forced to contact customers for no apparent reason because we had nothing else to do. This made for some very unpleasant customer interactions. Besides this part, it's a great place to work if you can handle the emotional labor involved with talking with customers all day regarding financial issues. (This part can be stressful but has nothing to do with the company, it's just the nature of the job). Small advancements can happen consistently but if you want to be promoted to a supervisor or salaried position, they don't become available too often.Horrible jobDon’t do it. Horrible job ever, don’t pay good, will make up lies just to fire you because they hired too many people and don’t have work for anyone.Fruad jobGreat CultureA company that truly cares about their help and I believe that they want the best for their employees. You learn a lot and the work is challenging. Knowing software and computer skills can help in your responsibilitiesadequate training and good managementI was a contracted remote contact tracer. The contract ended early with little notice. The work was rewarding for the most part. The management was kind and professional.Decent starter wfh jobGreat benefits and the company actually cares if you succeed.Low pay and horrible schedule starting out but if you stay long enough there are shift bids.Good pay and good managementI love my job and the staff I work with. They really take care of their employees. I loved the training class with Lloyd Sparks but the bubble was over packed with traineesPay, managementTraining over packedI enjoy working hereGreat place to work, excellent benefits and work/life balance. Have recommended to others. Pay is good for what it is. Love the flexibility and working remote.Great place to workI worked in the TPD call center for a year and honestly, it wasn't the best. It was high stress and overall I'd give it a 1 star. I then transferred to Enrollment Processing and I loved everything about that job.Productiveness loved itGreat wish they would hire me again they were Awesome they will you take care of their employees and recognize us the pay was great and the managers really care about youGreat except for payIf you don’t need the money Nelnet is a great place to work at. I love my supervisor and it’s a good company with good benefits. But you will be severely underpaid and raises are random at best.1Good managementGood management but the calls were stressful. Everyone who worked there was nice and friendly. Definitely a stressful environment though due the calls.DIY AKA Teach Yourself jobBetween working manual outbound assisting customers with back to back calls, background check nonsense that requires the most tedious of info! * I’ve been going back and forth with it since I was hired 4 months ago * poor training ! You don’t learn until you actually take a call and even then you have zero help, so many tasks to keep up with. Between getting negative points from calls you made mistakes on and having to find time to correct them while also taking calls, background check bs, being micro managed, threatened to lose job from mistakes THEY made smh and a terrible work shift of 12-9 Monday - Friday & dealing with customers when you barely know what you’re doing smh do not work here unless you are used to a demanding computer job that pays crumbs compared to the work that you actually put in. Do not recommend at all.Stressful and not enough quality trainingThe hiring process should have clued me in to the disorganization of this company. Training for an advisor role lasts about a month and a half but there is so little useful information given during training and you are then thrown on the phones without even listening in on live phone calls. They say it is because most agents are remote they do not have that capability which is laughable. People Services is almost impossible to get ahold of and when you do they are unable to answer your questions. The EQUIP process was an absolute mess. The job deserves higher pay for the amount of stress, knowledge, and volume of calls you have to deal with. They have high turnover because of the complexity of the role and lack of resources and support for when you are thrown to the wolves after subpar training and “bubble”. Very rude supervisors and abysmal communication.Paid insurance for first year, eto and benefits from day oneShort breaks, typical call center atmosphere even when working remotely, average pay, vto after training, horrible communicationIt is work from home. They haven't laid us off during Covid.This company sees you as a minion. You are just filling a space. For being such a large company they have horrible insurance rates. Regarding student loans, they don't care about making changes. They don't update employees and things change every single day. Management doesn't know what employees are doing. They can't do the same job yet they are in charge.Pretty decent payManagement is awful and doesn't care about you. Training is a joke.Really no advancement opportunities…To many roles not enough compensation and very low bonusesI have been at this company almost 3 years and have not been able to advance to other opportunities but have been trained to work multiple roles without a pay increase. Really feels like the company does not care about its employees.Great pay & benefits with lots of room for advancement. A company that truly cares how they impact this world, their neighborhood, & employees.Nelnet was a wonderful place to work for…if you can get through their grueling onboarding process. Even someone like me who has a zero interesting, very boring background was frustrated at the process. But it was worth it. Even though they’re a larger company I feel like Nelnet really cared about helping out their local community and overall cared about the employees…even if they didn’t know you personally.Only negative or downside I would comment about was the training process. The ladies who provided the training were great but they throw a TON of information at you in speeds I couldn’t keep up with. Unfortunately my daughters daycare shut down on my second day of training due to covid and I had to miss work here and there. I was playing “catch up” the rest of the training but was always swimming in a sea of confusion. And doing any type of catching up off the clock was a was a huge no no. I felt like it was easy for me to to get lost in the shuffle, like I was just another number.Pay, benefits, equipment providedGrueling onboarding process, lots & lots of information being thrown at you.Remote- Just startedAdvisor I, company seems to have a low turnover rate. Not much diversity in the supervisory team that I saw. They claim you can advance within the company.30 min lunchThey is a great company but the pay is not the best.Working there was a breeze but the pay is not worth it or can you live off the pay. The training is done great where you should how to do everything which is easy.Great place to work.The managers were really helpful if I had any questions. Also the coworkers were really helpful as well. I found the job task wasn't too hard to do. Unfortunately it was a contract position.Very nice facility, but you're never there beyond your shift, trapped at your cubicleGood consistent work with lots to learn. It's pretty easy once you learn it and they give you tons of resources to make the calls as easy as possible.Working for nelnetHonestly the job was horrible, management didn’t care how to work with you. Communication as poor, and training was worthless. No one cared about your personal life, no one trained you properly. You had no idea what you were doing 80% of the day.They made it seem like such an exciting job, and all my coworkers wanted to leave this company. It’s not worth the pain and misery to work for this company that will never care about you.Communication.Training is exhausting and mentally drainingI have been training for four weeks and the training is physically and mentally exhausting! You have do much material to consume that it makes your head hurt! Sitting in front of a computer with only 2 fifteen minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break is unfair. Supervisors don’t respond to employees immediately when they are needed. Also, hourly pay is not enough for all the tasks they want you to do during and after training.NoneShort breaks, too much material to consume, not enough pay for the extensive amount of work, Long hoursInnovativeYou will learn a lot. Must be willing to go outside of your comfort zone, but it is a wonderful place to work. Fun and engaging. They really teach you a lot that you can use in other fields.Schedules, emphasis on familyGreat benefitsI love the company honestly. I’m currently getting ready to embark on nesting. The training is amazing. You get to learn at your own pace and it’s a judgement free zone. You qualify for employee benefits on day one. Health, holiday pay, vacation, etc on DAY ONE!!! The pay is good. It varies based on your role and the hours are amazing no weekends with varying shifts during the week. Peak season stays open as late as 12 est but regular business hours are 8pm est.Solid place to work if you enjoy talking to a lot of clients. Management was good and bad depending on person.Solid place to work if you enjoy talking to a lot of clients. Management was good and bad depending on person. Work culture is decent with some advancements possible.ExcellentIt's a great place to work. The managers are great, the culture itself is great, they had 0 layoffs during the pandemic and were able to move everyone to remote successfully.Great benefitsThey do offer affordable benefits. But if you are an advisor expect to be confused during training. They lack organization while you are being trained. I was shifted back and forth with no explanation and no answers when I asked. Most people do want to help but they also constantly me tion Quality as a way to keep you on your toes.Good benefitsStressful, a lot of information to kearn in a short time.Everybody is willing to help when help is neededI like the company and the benefits are awesome! I think they threw us on phones kinda quick but I'm sure it's going to all come together! Some of the trainers are great, others not so much. It's like they know you're new to this but still give you a hard timeBenefitsShort breaks"

Very collaborative environment but going through some growing pains.You can work at your own pace and then you also have a coach if you need help or insight on different approaches on different aspectsWorking at your own pace and you can work as many hours as you want and if you don't feel like working then you don't have to work that day because when you work with penicillin you set up a business account so therefore you working for penister but you're still self-employed at the same timeDo you know healthcare. And you can take as many short breaks as you would likeVery Fun Place to workWork and Innovation is generally fun. Some of the internal systems are hard to use. Some of my team members were not that supportive and I did not get to work to my full potentialIt was a cool experienceIt was a fair and cool work place. A friendly environment to be in and nice people to work with. It's like being at a little city inside of San Francisco. It was great and i had a good time working there.Pinterest was a great experiencePinterest was a very cultural diverse job with many different faces that came with nothing but positive energy. I would say the best part about working for Pinterest was being able to experience how the CEO cared for his workers as if they didn’t work for him, and the amazing overtime they gave us.Great place to work.A great culture and atmosphere to work in. I learned so much with the team and the businesses I got to encounter every single day. The ability to collaborate in such an open setting really gave us ability to grow.Great Work/Life BalancePinterest believes in work/life balance, and the mission behind working for Pinterest is extremely inspiring no matter what department you're working for.free lunch, unlimited PTO, health insurance, stock optionsno 401K matchingproductive and fun place to work but getting politicGood flexible workplace but lots of red tape to navigate internally. The CEO has great product vision but not the best and most competant people in places of leadershipWorkplace CultureGreat culture!Overall the SMB team in the Ogden UT office is a fast-paced and positive environment. It is a very busy office and if you aren't intrinsically motivated Pinterest might not be the place for you.competitive and standardmy typical day at work is to Prepare all my tools then they send me a text what I'm going to do the whole day. I try to complete all the work I need to do. If I finish on time we have to do extra stuff. you Have to be flexible to move to different buildings and other stuff.Amazing CompanyI have loved my time at Pinterest. The culture is unreal and there is a certain work hard and play hard mentality. The only downside is having to live in a crowded city to work at an office if you want to promoteCulture, Free food, benefitsBig City officesPretty goodIt was a fun internship. The people are really friendly, the office is really nice, and the benefits are pretty on par with other companies on their level.Fun, forward thinking, but lacks good compensation.The Ogden Office is a great place to learn, for entry-level employees, but as far as earning potential in the SLC area, is quite poor. The reward is in knowledge not in compensation.Growth, snacks, fun.Pay.Pinterest was a great learning experience.The hardest part of the job was looking for businesses to speak with. It was very challenging and probably the most challenging jobs but it was the most rewarding.Just sosoLike the team. Dislike the management who doesn't know anything. Brand new equipment t to use which is a plus.Most teammates act way too spoiled meaning they act like they are better than this place. Leaving a mess at their station and bathroom allowing someone else to pick up after them.Free Lunch and DrinkYou can be payed better elsewhere"

Adobe,"Excellent place to workAwesome team to work with excellent place to grow the career. Would work with all the teams, Good employee recognition good company benefits with exc.As the culture gets larger, individuals have no sayIt used to be a much better place to work. The pandemic and I'm not sure what else seems to have tipped things upside down and it feels disconnected and lacking in purpose except to work hard, hard, hardindividual managers careBureaucracyFun place to workTeam oriented and really care about employees. Free lunches, many Department activities. Management was easy to talk to and felt like I was important. They gave me the opportunity to grow. I started off as a production line assembler and ended being in inventory control.Stock optionsToo much overtime.Productive and fun placeOverall a good place to work at, remote culture is nice, managers are helpful and overall team members are sweet and kind. Pay standards could be updaredHit or miss company, but the misses are h*ll on earth.I have worked here since 2020 and it feels like management forgets this every week or so. You will not get adequate support with onboarding, there are so many holes in documentation and the engineers are so overloaded that they are not willing to help at all. You will be confused and alone, express this, and still get no help and get all the blame in this regard. Ensure your manager is good before you join, this is a huge determiner of your experience.Poor management, no innovation, unfulfilling work.Enjoyable place to work, happy to see MondaysInteresting work and great colleagues - Adobe cares about it's people.Would recommend Adobe as a place to work.Always learning due to fast product development. However, progression to leadership roles is difficult as there are few opportunities.Interesting products, always more to learn, healthy workplace culture, flexibility, largest client's in regionLack of progression opportunitiesExcellent culture for a large companyFor a large company, Adobe has an excellent culture for its employees. It strives for diversity and inclusion but can be slow moving at times (but Adobe is very big).There is a lot of variation depending on what team/business unit you are in. Some places have better engineering practices and career growth than others. Depending on your level, it can be hard to find a path for advancement.Overall culture, salaryVariability among teams, advancementHardly any con. Good people, small teams, lots of growth opportunity, good perks.I was a SWE intern and the expectations were reasonable and even very busy people made time for me. Everyone always encouraged me and celebrated my successes.Only thing would be a lack of diversity in some of the engineering teams (mine included)Sales Managers can be bulliesIt's all about the accounts you get. Some of the sales managers can be bullies and have their favorites. Very little support unless you have a super large deal.A fun job with plenty of hours.you had to get the documents ready to ship with shipment. Communicate with others on the status of the documents. File packing slips and look up shipments for customers. The friends their are nice too.4 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Benefits, esp. the sabatticalWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Long hrs expected. bottom X% are laid off annually right around the holidaysWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?great supportive and inclusiveBest place to workI have been here for 4 years and it has been by far, the best experience that I have ever had at a company. The culture is so inclusive, and the compensation and benefits are the best I have ever experienced.Culture, time off, flexibility of workspace, top leadership, and compensationStress and bias for action can be a bit overwhelming, but it keeps it interesting.I just joined but I felt that Adobe gives value to every individualI just joined but I felt that Adobe gives value to every individual. My manager is very focused and appreciative. It has tons of material for self-learning and is partnered with many external learning platforms. Benefits are good but the only cons I would say is managing multiple small projects at the same time when the expectation is not properly defined. It sometimes causes anxiety while filling timesheetUna gran empresa para trabajar, trabajo en equipo, colaboración, constante esfuerzo para hacer equipo.Una excelente empresa, innovadora, siempre en dinámica de cambio, nuevos productos y capacidades que es muy difícil dar seguimiento. Liderazgo de empuje pero a veces muy estresante. Aunque la empresa cuida el balance de vida las exigencias diarias terminan en jornadas extensas de 10 horas diarias por lo menos. Acercamientos regulares para hacerte sentir parte del equipo.Adobe culture truly reflects its core valuesGenuine - Exceptional - Innovative - InvolvedAdobe employees exhibit these values. Leadership expects the same of themselvesTerrific place for personal & professional growth with terrific benefits.Outstanding SoltionsConsistent focus on Customer SatisfactionExciting, fast paced, innovative & challenging environmentHard to replicate these pros at other companiesGreat place to work, best job I've ever hadThere's a time when you realize that going to work is a joy and you've lost track of the time again building something that you can be pretty proud. As a bonus you've helped plenty of friends and customers and other folks do something creative and meaningful. I got the chance to enable books to be published, art to be appreciated, and deadlines to be met when people took advantage of my skills and knowledge that I freely gave because I could. All that and a bag of chips happened at Adobe.Almost too many to listSome California-related management stuffgreat work/life balanceThe best thing for me was the work/life balance. But with that comes missed opportunities that only comes if you're willing to get outside your comfort zone.great opportunities for advancement and learning if you're willing to learn outside your domainyou get to work on the same thing using different technologies as the team/product scales and evolveOpportunityThe most important benefit of working at Adobe is that the company provides opportunities to play your role to the best of your ability, or invent a role that does allow you room to grow.Unlimited opportunity for the hard workerToo many MBA's!Lack of balance/support during pandemic.Note- Hired and left during COVID WFHWork was well defined and paid. Company itself was great and fantastic benefits. Seemed to be a function/team specific issue and advancement couldn't come soon enough to wait it out.Customers can be very needy and you will end up needing to work beyond 9-6 most days. Management is generally supportive but I found many un-supportive teammates. Attempts to reach out for help were often met with dismissal or rude response from senior employees. Folks outside of the support org especially very rude to support engineers.Best company in the world.Everything about this company is superb: culture, compensation, work life balance, working environment, work-life balance, fast paced development, and of course - dedicated and fun TEAM.Great stock options, education compensation, free schedule, perfect hardwareI really can’t think of anyGreat company!Absolutely great company! After 5 years in the company, I made friends for my whole life and had fantastic work experience. Excellent working conditions, progressive management. During my journey with Adobe, I got 2 times promoted.Everything is greatNoExcellent place to workAwesome team to work with excellent place to grow the career. Would work with all the teams, Good employee recognition good company benefits with exc.Great for InternsDefinitely a great internship experience due to everything you can learnand everyone you can meet. It was remote for me though so it lost a lot of aspects such as connecting with people organically, but overall a great place to learn.1AdobeNice place to work, layback people, some of the code is very messy. They are advancing the field of AR. You will solve some hard problems. The people you work with are nice and helpfull.Nice Folks, Remote, work life balanceI am stuck in an inglorious position as contractor, I just need a role change.It has nice cafeteria and ping pong table.1. The Review system is serious and the manager evaluates you at every work you do and the feedbacks from the customer.2. the office atmosphere is good but the stress level is quite high.3. Company encourages to learn new skill sets but for me I can only find limited time to learn new stuffs.Good work/life balance, management is a letdownLittle job security for contractors of which they use as full-time employees. Work/life balance however is terrific, and colleagues are easy to work with.Work/Life BalanceManagement, No vision for future stateproductive and nice work cultureadobe is a great place to work, great benefits, unlimited PTO, creative and nice work culture, and great work flexibility depending on what team you are on.Great benefits and co workers, hard to advanceAdobe provides it's employees with every benefit they could need, with fair compensation in terms of salary, albeit a bit below market value compared with similar companies. However, with a company of this size, it's hard to move up in the ladder without really overexerting yourself to make your work stand out.Benefits, co-workers, fair managementLong work days, feels like you're in a rat race at timesGreat company!Joined after receiving my MBA, great company for recent gras. Amazing benefits, team members go out of their way to help you out, even folks in different BU's. Cool products and great work life balance. Offers continuous training and business development, and they assign you impactful work. Management really cares about every employee and also provides fun team building events.- Perks (health fund, free snacks / drinks, pay for public transportation to work); flexible working environment, empathetic managers; amazing, intelligent, and friendly co-workers; company is seeing great growth and the atmosphere is really transparentCan't think of anyGreat Management and Cultureawesome company to work for. They have very professional and personal leadership at all levels. Extremely innovative and clear strategy. They are on a roll!Great Benefitslots of hours (but so does the whole team)They added benefit before you knew you needed them.Always looking out for their employees, Excellent employer. They think of benefits that you need before you could think to ask. Can't say enough good about them.a creative place to work inI enjoyed collaborating with different creatives on projects. The work environment was fast paced but rewarding. There were constantly new projects to work on and old projects to finish.Toxic Woke climateAdobe is unfortunately a Terrible place to work. I just transitioned from acquisition company and I am completely stunned at how political the climate is here. So called ""Adobe for all"" is nothing more than corporate cancel culture. Unless you have the right skin color or other preferences it’s barely even covert you are to keep your mouth shut.Work elsewhere is my recommendationRemote officeBad culture, no PPO, extremely leftist political viewsTime for work and playIt was great to work on software that helped people's productivity and creativity. People are treated like adults who can manage their time efficiently. There is a stocked kitchen, video game consoles, pingpong, etc. Benefits are generous.Smart people, good pay and benefitsManagement can be a bit laxRewarding and challengingIt's a great place to work. Rewarding and flexible, with a focus on employee well-being. The best people rise to the top, usually. I feel appreciated and rewarded for the work I do.People-first cultureSome positions understaffedToo politicalI recommend people who wants to work here to learn to be more political than being smart. I had a manager that was managing the division like 7-11. That's why i quit.Great office spaceToo politicalWell paid to sweat the detailsGood fundamentals and strategy but needs a qualified COO. Command and control culture in some groups. Holiday shutdowns are good practice and benefits are solid.Stagnant Corporation Masquerading as Tech InnovatorAdobe has two good products, photoshop and Acrobat (PDF Reader). They have had these two products for over two decades. All other product releases failed. Yes, some people use them, but any usage is strictly attributable to Adobe‘s brand recognition, and not the actual proficiency of the product. The culture at Adobe is bland. It is nonexistent, it is cold. None of the budget is allocated towards team morale activities. During my 15 months there, I think there was one happy hour. Their technology is a mess, their leader ship is embarrassing, and worst of all, the company has no clear-cut direction. Nobody can actually tell you what the company is working towards. Essentially, Photoshop pays the bills and that’s all that matters.Great Benefits & Decent CompensationLow morale, Nonexistent Senior Leadership, Too Big, No CohesonEgos and politicsToo many egos once you are director level or above. Too many layers of mgmt and egos to work around to get anything done.Adobe knows b2c but still has no clue on B2B mid market and SMB.Likes to buy solid MM companies, keep the mgmt team for a year and then they all leave or are let go...Marketo, Magento, Echo Sign, and more are good examples.Cafe, salary and smart pplEgos, bullies and many leaders have been there too long.Good perks, insurance and education benefitsA lot of product team(support and sales) in India works in night shifts unless you are in the core engineering team. Rest everything is good.Not many IJP opportunities. so learn and move outfree food, education reimbursement, health benefitsnight shifts, average hikesRelaxed culture and supportive coworkersI really enjoy my time as an intern at Adobe although the position is remote, I feel moderately connected. Really nice manager, and helpful coworkers. The benefits are amazing, and the pay is awesome! I have nothing to complain.Great company cultureLow impact workFind a better company, I dare youAdobe is incredible, at least in Utah. I love working there and plan to spend as many years there as they'll have me! Compensation is fair and the people are top notch.Excellent place to workAwesome team to work with excellent place to grow the career. Would work with all the teams, Good employee recognition good company benefits with exc.Good culture with decent workInterned at Adobe during the summer. I found the team and the people around to be helpful. The company culture is unmatched. Ownership of product is encouraged.Wellness benefits, Good payNoneGreat companyI love the company but the teams can be hit or miss. Most teams are based in SF/San Jose so if you want to advance, location is something to keep in mind.I learn a lot here.My Manager is really great. Help me to clear understand with the work instruction and goal and support in each way to succeed in those goal.I learn a lot here.bureaucratic & process oriented organizationCould be good or bad, depending on what you want. Adobe is process defined organization, hence things move slowly.You will need lot of approvals from various set of stakeholders, which points a lot of accountability on your head.Fun and Productive Environment to Work inIt feel's young with people full of energy with nice office environment one can image. Team work is a must and many technical meeting by developers of all levels to review and form new actionable ideas.Office environment and locationOn-site parking is limited; open envirment tend to be noisy in generalGreat company for individuals truly interested in technologyGreat place for truly talented individuals seeking to make a difference, but the work culture seems to have taken a hit in recent years especially in business organizations.BewareThere are good managers and bad ones. Hopefully you get a good one. They prioritize diversity to the point that it becomes detrimental. It would be one thing if internal diversity were commensurate with the community at large, however, that is not the case. The end result is the reverse discrimination. Good luck.Great and stable company if you're full-timeI loved working at Adobe, but being a contractor made me feel like a second class citizen. My team was great, but there was no room for advancement and I was stonewalled when I wanted to pursue more advanced tasks and projects and take on more responsibility. TVC culture is a pox and actively works against individual growth. But the cafeteria was great I guess.Good team workAs an individual contributor, you really have a lot of autonomy in the work you do and can make big plays with your team. Orders don't come down from executives -- the teams decide what they want to do and how to do it, start to finish, on their own terms. You of course get direction and insight from people higher up, but engineers, product managers, designers, and business stakeholders all work together in autonomous teams to make things happen. As a Data Analyst, your work is always high impact, and you get to shape how your team operates.Ping PongAs a contractor, there seems to be a negative treatment to contractors versus full-time employees. Contractors are not provided there own workspace, and each day bumped to other locations. Adobe's amenities are not equally provided to all employees, just full-timers. This treatment makes a person feel like an outcast in a culture that is pretty cool for those that are brought on full-time. Contribution to the success of the business is equal, however, not culture.My specific manager did not have emotional intelligence and treated her subordinate poorly, even those that were full-time.Other teams I worked with seemed very happy, and their bosses were pretty friendly and eager to help other teams.The work itself was excellent, and the experience of utilizing one of the most powerful marketing platforms and analytics to generate interest in Adobe's products and services was a privilege and would enjoy working there if offered a position ""full-time."" One lousy boss out of many was just bad luck.N/aVery awesome experience. The people are genuine, happy to help. I was able to learn from across the company. You just need to reach out to people. Good luckGreat Culture. Slow GrowthI enjoyed my time at Adobe. I learned and grew in my career. The Sales culture is different than the overall company culture. Advancing and feeling secure don't come with the sales role.Great Culture and Place to WorkSlow Compensation and Position GrowthLack of mission and focus at every levelThis is very siloed company. Each group operates under a different management structure. The management structures vary from agile to okr to their own inventions.Innovation is stymied by the lack of coordination between teams.Overall a very top down environment.Great place to stick around if you have an ever-evolving roleAs a member of IT, I've had the pleasure of speaking/working with folks from almost every type of role within the company. There is so much opportunity here at Adobe, but some roles may leave little room for advancement and require lateral moves in order to allow for upward mobility.Although my IT org doesn't allow for work-from-home opportunities, the offices are very accommodating in terms of comforts and productivity needs. I left a job that allowed for 100% remote work so that I could commute and show up here every day, and I have no complaints about it.Pay is alright. Competitive rates for IT are definitely out there, considering the growing scope of work for IT roles here.The benefits here are excellent. I really get a brain break during the bi-annual shutdowns (a week during July 4th and a week during Christmas/New Years).Management is management. They're not always skilled to have a comprehending head in the foxholes with members of the roles they oversee, so this can be frustrating when their personality lacks empathy on top of unfamiliarity of inner workings. This isn't specific to Adobe, it's just how managers can be anywhere you go. Maybe more promotion from within would help here, but sometimes personalities are more important that backgrounds when it comes to leadership.If you work in Adobe, don't do it in a remote officeComp was good, especially the stock purchase plan. Worked in the NYC but most decisions made in San Jose without input. Management in company is not so great. If you're not working on one of the core products, you're not treated so well. Meh...Great company overallI love Adobe and what they stand for, it gets me energized hearing about it at each employee meeting. Overall it's fantastic, and I can't ask for anything better, but it can be very PC and hard to grow your career upwards.Nice place to work if Adobe has good projectsGood projects to work on but recently the head hancos they are sending work to overseas, so basically stealing jobs from America and sending to overseas.Worklife balance is greatWork life balance is excellent. There are a lot of smart folks you can collaborate ideas with here. I have a family and my boss is understanding of my schedule and fair.Worklife balancelunches are not always consistantly good. They look good but do not taste good most of the timePeople's companyAdobe values its people and is a great company to work with. Adobe has great values and it tries to live by them. The company does an amazing job at diversity and inclusion. Adobe promotes work life balance for its employees and offers some really great benefits.GoodGreat place to work and fun people looking around and a very high-functioning energetic atmosphere. also bonuses and Retreats of business outings and very kind people too be around"

ETC boasts a very laid back work environment.Great Place to work, but can be stagnant with no advancementPeople at ETC are awesome! Most folks have worked there more than 10 years, which means options to move up or work in a different area are extremely limited. But, the company is very committed to promoting from within - they consistently make good management decisions and management cares about employees.If you are comfortable in the Madison area, and looking for a nice company with excellent commitment to customer service - this is a great place to work!However, be prepared to wait a number of years at least to move to a different role. So make sure you're in something you really enjoy and can do for awhile.Good company if you're lucky, but treats temps like garbage.I turned down a position they offered me, because it was going to pay less than the job I was currently at. So instead, they offered me different position with much higher pay. Of course I accepted! After only two weeks, they pull me out, move me to the position that I had *originally turned down*, and cut my salary by a quarter. Three or four more weeks pass, and then they have the temp agency randomly call me after work one day to let me go, because ""the work was slowing down."" No warning whatsoever, just don't come in tomorrow and that's that. The position was through a temp agency, so of course I don't have any rights. It sure would've been nice to know that they didn't need workers when I quit my job for them. Real nice way to treat people. Looking for a union job next.Friendly and chill work environment.

They are very concerned with never having to lay people off and that has them walking a line of excellent job security and over-working the current employees. Other than that, the company has a great mission they stick to and are exceptionally versatile and quite admirable in their ability to adapt and find new markets.Best place to workI've worked here as a ""summer student"" for almost four years. They were very accommodating and flexible with my schedule. I appreciate the culture we have here at ETC,very laid back and friendly. I moved away and went to a different job for a 9-month period and ended up coming back because I missed my job at ETC. Everyone is always smiling and happy to be at work.

I have learned an extraordinary amount of material regarding electronics and new product testing and have met a whole bunch of wonderful coworkers that I'm happy to call friends. ETC boasts a very laid back work environment.Great Place to work, but can be stagnant with no advancementPeople at ETC are awesome! Most folks have worked there more than 10 years, which means options to move up or work in a different area are extremely limited. But, the company is very committed to promoting from within - they consistently make good management decisions and management cares about employees.If you are comfortable in the Madison area, and looking for a nice company with excellent commitment to customer service - this is a great place to work!However, be prepared to wait a number of years at least to move to a different role. So make sure you're in something you really enjoy and can do for awhile.Good company if you're lucky, but treats temps like garbage.I turned down a position they offered me, because it was going to pay less than the job I was currently at. So instead, they offered me different position with much higher pay. Of course I accepted! After only two weeks, they pull me out, move me to the position that I had *originally turned down*, and cut my salary by a quarter. Three or four more weeks pass, and then they have the temp agency randomly call me after work one day to let me go, because ""the work was slowing down."" No warning whatsoever, just don't come in tomorrow and that's that. The position was through a temp agency, so of course I don't have any rights. It sure would've been nice to know that they didn't need workers when I quit my job for them. Real nice way to treat people. Looking for a union job next.Friendly and chill work environment. Great hours.No benefits, manipulates you into taking a job you didn't acceptMake money and have fun!Great people, family oriented, fair pay!

With very little competition in the marketplace, the forward direction of the company is a little scattered at the moment.All in all, the management is great, the corporate culture is amazing, and the benefits are fantastic.Incredible companyIt's an incredible company to work for with amazing ideals and accessible culture. They are very concerned with never having to lay people off and that has them walking a line of excellent job security and over-working the current employees. Other than that, the company has a great mission they stick to and are exceptionally versatile and quite admirable in their ability to adapt and find new markets.Best place to workI've worked here as a ""summer student"" for almost four years. They were very accommodating and flexible with my schedule. I appreciate the culture we have here at ETC,very laid back and friendly. I moved away and went to a different job for a 9-month period and ended up coming back because I missed my job at ETC. Everyone is always smiling and happy to be at work. Would highly recommend working here. The CEO is a very caring, giving person and he only wants the best for his company.EverythingNothingHave fun and make moneyManager was awesome for celebrating the employees mostly every other month for potluck, bowling, and outside picnics just to loosen up from working hard and knows how to motivate the employees.Lunch, bowling, ice skating, picnicsNot enoughflexible work placeElectronic Theatre Control is a very good place to work for.

I enjoyed being there and working with my team. I also enjoyed Cummins University which provided training and testing in different areas pertaining to the business. Unfortunately as with any large corporation, Corporate Restructuring eliminated my position.Ability to boost morale through fun activities and community serviceCorporate Office is out of touch with employeesGood coworkers and bosses, always changing hoursLoved my coworkers and my bosses weren’t overbearing, but the schedule wasn’t too predictable.

It's a toxic environment that doesn't truly care about the well-being of its employees. It's sad to see such a great company go into the trash because employees are just a number.Excellent pay depending on Job Grade.Cummins can potentially be a well paying place to work, if you don't mind practically living in the building. Moving from one line or shift to another is insanity. Due to seniority and union relationships. Employees typically have a ""better than you"" mentally that makes it uncomfortable while working a majority of the time.Good place to workGood payBad management and very clicky. Nice people, ice bread rolls from machine. And sausage rolls, lovely tea, nice tea and nice tea. The was nice very nice.Best company to ever be employedEmployees first, profits second. Healthy and thoughtful working working environment. Really motivating and positive atmosphere throughout. They really strive to cross train and develop every employee to succeed in the company.Great place to learnGood place to work for management great great training procedures no weekend required most of the time you can level up quick raises every year and decent bonusI enjoyed working for Cummins this is the main reason for wanting to return.You will have a good degree in learning at a high level.The work can be demanding,but that is the price you pay for when your company builds quality components.Benefits are goodDo not recommend working here if you want any kind of life. They do notcare about workers or their families. Work 13 days straight have one day off then another 13. You get punished if THEIR MACHINES break down by working extra days to hit a number no matter what you have planned.4 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?The pay is the best partWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No days offWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Safe environmentWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Long days 10 plus hours1 starWhat is the best part of working at the company?The BenefitsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?ManagementWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Bunch of liesWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Aggravated2Good payGood pay not too good management but hey wasn’t too bad at all it’s like a challenge that a lot of people love to take on not too hard but you will workGood place to workI only resigned due to medical.

I miss my job!Great companyDecent place to workJob is not hard, just stay to yourself and you will be ok or less likely to be involved in work politics.I learned alot working there, training is not hard to learn. Helpful to be a hands on learner.Corporate/Management is too full of themselves to be relevant to what you do out in the field.As the old saying goes,” **it rolls down hill”. ‘Mother Cummins’ and Management have a high opinion of themselves and rather than staying focused on what should be their core competencies, they put a lot of their capital into coming up with misguided plans that roll down hill and land on the shoulders of Territory Reps and others who have to face end users and try to explain their confusing policies, clean up their messes, and be put under pressure to sell their overpriced but only average quality parts and service.Then every handful of years, they will try to get their act together by doing a disorganized restructuring, having layoffs, only to have no better outcome than they had before. Meanwhile, the corporate leadership back in Columbus get obscene multi-million dollar bonuses and boast about what a great ‘woke’ company they are!Great pay and benefits if you don’t mind your life revolving around workI worked At Cummins on 3 separateoccasions and each time felt the same as the last. Neither good nor bad it’s easy to get stuck there for years on end due to the great pay and benefits offered by the company.Some of which include a partially company matched 401k, a health-card containing $1100 for any medical expenses reloaded yearly, dental insurance that covers cleanings, decent medical coverage too.The 19 days on 2 off gets old though. As a temp you can expect to be worked sometimes multiple weekends in a row your not actually guaranteed two days off a month until after you get your time in.As you can imagine with easy work and long work weeks there is bound to be some drama and there is.. a lot.. people will throw you under the bus so be careful there! Overall I didnt have any issues but beware!They will drug test you twice once ar the beginning of your 6 month temporary assignment and another time by Cummins health center themselves.Paid breaks, great pay, benefits, clean environment, air conditioning, easy workShort lunch 20 min, only 2 days off a month, only ~7 sick days for the entire year, vacation accumulates yearly with 3-7 days given initially after 6 months.Excellent workplaceGood place to work, especially the advantage of working for somewhere that makes the solid Cummins engine. Training was fantastic, especially considering the depth of work that is required.The company itself is a great place to work. I have no complaintsManagement teams need development. Very limited management and people skills. Most managers had very little secondary education such as college. Management had difficulties meeting. maintaining, and relating to higher quality standards.People you work with are amazing management are not that greatMost the people you work with are good people but the management and safety team only seem to care if it affects them you get to move to new positions but it takes weeks to get The pay increase and they don't back date it to when you start the job. Benefits are definitely good along with the IRA accounts it's nice that they have an inhouse clinic but the management plays favoritismold grand father CompanyThe review title says it all. OLD grand fathered company. Long working hours and minimal work life balance. Management is usually good but they dont care remaining 90% of work force and only look up at top 10%.People culture before it was coolThe human component is very important at Cummins. Like with most companies the work life balance and culture is dependant on the health of the organization you report through. Great company as a wholeGood place, compensation not so muchA good place to work, for the most part, the newer employees coming in get better and better pay and employees who have been here fall behind. I found out recently new hires are making more than those of us who have been with the company and was told ""it has happened to us all, it's part of the job if you just stick with it and don't leave the pay will eventually even out."" Not a rousing endorsement to stay when you are not being compensated to match incoming individuals with no prior work experience.Results May Vary By LocationI worked at a branch in Southern California, and then a year after quitting I relocated to work in Arizona. Now the So Cal branch was awesome, we had an amazing team in every department, techs, supervisors, parts, management. Compensation was beyond any of our competitors and we didn't work weekends.HOWEVER, then I went to Arizona and compensation was severely lacking in all departments compared to the current cost of living in the state and there were no intentions on raising it at any point within the next 2+ years. Also our branch manager transferred and the new (1st time) branch manager had absolutely no clue what he was doing and quickly divided the job that used to work extraordinarily well as one big team. He'd blame others for his own mistakes and then terminated 1 or more employees for his own (unreasonable) justifications. It's very hard to rate Cummins as a whole because they allow branch managers to fire employees at their own will, yet it takes a team of departments to HIRE new employees. So if you have a bad manager, you risk failure in the branch and a terrible experience with the company.No weekends (varies by location), great benefits, compensation (varies) but was great in California, discounts on a lot of brands in various industries as an employee, including car dealerships, sporting events, etc.Inconsistent management, Inconsistent ""flat rate"" pricing, lack of staffing, high turnover rates throughout the company, multiple layoffs within my 4 years in the company, corporate is all about numbers and return on investment, huge pressure to keep numbers up regardless the factors you're battling, Human Resources has way too much unchecked powerGood place to start your careerGreat place to start your career right out of university especially for international student.. Cummins sponsors H1B visa and are very good with GC sponsorship as well.. There are opportunities to grow but you need to be with the right manager who puts you on the right projects.. Hard work by itself wouldn't get you anywhere..clean and air conditioned. easy work. bad managementEasy work, A/C, Clean. Highly woke management political correctness is stifeling. Drama, hours are unpredictable, management doesn't hold people accountable.RunGreat place to work if you enjoy chaos, manipulation and upper management letting you do what you want to avoid anything getting to head of corporateYou get the opportunity to work on the world's best diesels.Management sucks. Worst in the industry. Surround themselves with talent & then claim all the glory. Fellow technicians on the floor are some of the best in the industry. Since the CSSNA transition shop operations feel more like assembly line operations.No weekends, unlimited training available.Management, pay, benefits.Great people at a branch level, but corporate processes consume your motivationMost days were quite enjoyable. Between the people you work with and local management, everyone worked well together and were usually happy to help one another out. Unfortunately, local management really has no say in what the focus of the month is (which usually does not have customer satisfaction in mind). Labor rates, ludicrous miscellaneous fees and corporate wokeness eventually drove me out of there.Great group of people on a local level, pay, benefitsCompany wants to force a ""culture"" on employees vs letting them just do their job, Processes tend to be redundant and feel purposeless.Best work placeI have worked there before and I loved it easy work not hard at all good pay and good hours u might have to work every other weekendBut other the. That it’s greatAcChanging of shift hoursHigh turnover of new hires (>25% in first 24 months)Decent products, but the turnover of new professional hires is horrendous.

There is a major issue with favoritism and management hiring their friends to work under them. If you are not part of the crowd with Cummins management then you won't get very far. Upper management doesn't care about what happens to you if you aren't part of their crowd. It's like a high school popularity contest. You get great vacation time but good luck trying to use it. They put a ton of work on your desk knowing you won't be able to get through everything but then wonder why everything is so messed up.Great benefitsFeels like a high school popularity contest, if you aren't in with upper management they don't care about you.Extreme amount of favoritism.Promotions and raises were fairly nonexistent. Raises were given as a small percentage. My suggestion would be to only accept a salary you are comfortable with. I was made promises of wage increases that were never met during my employment. I met all efficiency goals required and was given budget related excuses not the compensation.Training and certifications were a plus.Great place to work, it for the mentally weakIt’s 19 days straight, be prepared to work it. Every once in a while you’ll get a weekend off.

Pay is lower and raises slow to come. Overtime always available.Soul crushing cubiclesI was brought in, specifically as a PhD chemist. Unfortunately, the job was extremely low grade--moving inventory around, cleaning things. Utterly pointless and demeaning. Which would be fine, other than the work has nothing to do with the job description or interview. AVOID this place. Unless you're a mindless Koolaid drinker, it's a dreadful place to be. Low pay, poor insurance. Idiotic meetings like I have never seen before. I realized it wouldn't be a high end R and D job, but what I found was actually shameful. The ""culture"" was one where everything was a witch hunt. Anything goes wrong, even something minor, someone was going to hang for it. And not taken aside and corrected. After being spoken to privately, then it had to come up at the weekly staff meeting, then again at the technician meeting. Just to make absolutely certain whoever was responsible was deeply shamed by it. I have no idea how some of these poor folks lasted decades there.ProductiveThis company is a good place to work at and the pay is good and advancement is great. I highly recommend the maintenance program at cummins. They also pay for your schoolingGreat work/life balanceWork life balance is great with strong focus on family and taking the time you need.Opportunities to progress to those who seek it out. overall good benefits for the work you performlove the job not managementOverall the Company was great. Management had terrible turnaround with having a new manager every 2-4months.As a growing company they were constantly changing policies and procedures, not even giving enough time to learn the current policies.growth was a little difficult. Although it was an issues specific to our shop due to being a union shop.Again, overall training and benefits were great, the company as a whole is a great company to work with. The only reason I left was do to relocating.Has a good PR dept and that's about it.Management is incompetent, and doesn't actually manage anything. Their fix all is forced overtime, which doesn't actually fix anything because the production employees aren't the reason they are always behind.They claim to respect their employees, but their actions and policies make you feel like they think they own you.There are some really great people to work with.Management is incompetent to the highest degreeGreat company to work forHas a small town feel with a corporate environment.

INTEL,"Productive, uplifting, encouraging, excellent place to work.Intel in my opinion is the best place to work. They have outstanding benefits. Everyone is very positive.

You will get to learn a lot but the compensation is moderateI interned at Intel for 3 months in the Analog Design team. A mentor was assigned to me and I used to give daily updates to him.The good part is that the work is properly assigned based on ones interests and also expertise and the team members are extremely helpful and we can ask any doubts to our mentors.The bad part is that the compensation is not up to the mark considering the company's stature.Very stressful work culture.Very stressful work culture.A typical day at work is full of meetings.Not much to learn new things.management is clueless.workplace culture - Stressfull.Good work facilities.Too much workExperience will all depend on what group you're in.There are plenty of areas at Intel that are great places to work. Generally speaking things get a lot better outside the fab than in it.Within the fab job security tends to be high, but expectations range from demanding but manageable to extremely unreasonable. In my experience as a module engineer the issues with some of the highest turnover modules tend to be created by GLs and EMs rather than higher level policies.A lot of it is excessive meetings. Meetings would be scheduled to go over data daily for separate efforts or projects. GLs would regularly roll into their own meetings 10-15 minutes late and demand the entire thing restart, or sometimes they'd just not show up at all. It wasn't unusual to be in 6 hours of scheduled meetings a day. So then how do you actually generate the data to discuss in these meetings? You work all night, of course. Oh, and don't forget that you're responsible for maintaining a fleet of production equipment and keeping it available for manufacturing (with some tests that bring them down being dubious anyway- understanding of the stats used in SPC at Intel is often pretty weak).It all results in working late nights and weekends trying to fulfill an impossible array of demands. A lot of work is done poorly just because people are desperately doing anything they can think of to get their managers off their backs (this is true of engineers and GLs).However, I felt a strong sense of camaraderie among (most of) the engineers. Everyone knows how tough it is and most people are willing to try to help one another. Not all modules are bad, either.Free coffee/soda, good (but not exceptional) benefits, good co-workersknown problem managers are entrenched and will almost never be removed, excessive meetings, constant night/weekend/holiday workGood place, very smart people.Worked in R&D plant in Hillsboro.

Long hoursLack of career growth, micro managmentSummer internI did not enjoy my time there. I worked remotely on a project meant for 2 people but was told I was to do it myself. Weekly checkins with managers went well and was told presentation of recommendations went well. They were even going to adopt my recommendations. At the end I was not hired as full time. I did not see it coming as I was told I was doing a good job by many parties throughout the summer. How could you have someone work independently, with virtually no guidance on a project and then tell them ""we're going to take your recommendation but not you."" Now they are laying off 1,000 in the workforce. I would not feel comfortable working for a company that lays off hard working people in the name of profit. Maybe try cutting your outrageous top end salaries to save profit.No sense of accomplishmentSome challenges there, but most time boring. i am in sales/marcketing group.I think the company has over hired too many people in the sales group b/c Intel sells only few product with very focused cleints.2 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Nothing is best part here.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Toxic management.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Noisy and variety of culturesWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Very stressful most of the day.most employee based company I ever worked foremployee managed company with attention to work life balance and fairness.

They provide wonderful benefits and management is is supportive and my whole group worked as a team, backing one another. I had a 3-year contract as an actual Intel employee and if they hadn't put a freeze on adding head count when my contract was up, I would still be there. I loved working at Intel.Overall, great place to work, some issue with some managersOverall great place and people to work for and with. Highly intelligent colleagues and employees. I would recommend them to anyone and would work there again. I enjoyed the environment and work. The bad: My manager let me go for a reason his manager didn't agree with but was supporting his decision. All my quarterly reviews and work were always great and even showed that I excelled from year to year, yet they were willing to let me go because of politics and my managers manager let it happened (even though he disagreed with it). So now I question the integrity of the hierarchy.But again, overall it was a ""great place to work.""it was fineSpent a year here. It was alright. Wouldn't work for them again.Disorganized to say the least, the relationship between planning and actual work is aggressively uncoordinated.Free mealsA lotExcellent life/work balanceYou are pretty much scheduled to work 14 days a month and on top of that, you get a lot of paid leave, vacation and holiday options. Rotating 3 days on 4 days off per week and vice versa.Fast paced job with great team mates!Good pay and team mates, a bit hard if you have little ones at home. Other than that this is a fun and fast work environment. Everyone tries to help you learn and encourages you to grow. They’re very supportiveIntel is the corporate giant in the Portland area; expect as muchGetting into Intel as a full-time (blue badge) employee is a coveted position. It's a big company and the pay is decent, but with big companies you have to expect typical corporate shenanigans in terms of how employees are treated. You won't be treated like an indentured servant, but the company has no problem exploiting your labor and punishing you for any slights.Decent pay and benefits, great people to work withlack of opportunity to advance/promote, unequal pay for veteran versus new employeesGreat place to workI'm grateful to had the opportunity to work at Intel for over 16 years. No main issues with upper management and was able expand my work abilities to continued being successful on a yearly basis. If you're eager to learn, communicate with your supervisor and it'll eventually happen.Bow down to the factory.The typical day is filled with distractions from other groups who impose their shortcomings onto other groups because they either planned poorly or undermined processes that are in place.Great compensation and flexibility. I work from home, which is why I'm not looking to leave.The culture is not encouraging. There is little time for developing new competencies. Finally, it is very difficult to assume new roles unless you fit in.Good company, friendly people, but the payment is not fair at allI wish they can take care of their employees more and give some bonuses and encouragementsAlso would like them to support employees who have goals and target to reach outIntel is good place to workIntel is great place to work and has been good employer so far. I would recommend people to find work at Intel. For growth, you need to move around in the group.It's a different cultureWas great until they moved operations overseas, understood the business decision, no sense in shipping back and forth just to test here in the states and have end user in AsiaLarge corporation. Huge variability on management, expectations and work/life balance.The culture is highly variable with 100k+ employees worldwide working from manufacturing to finance, software, etc. Some managers treat you respectfully like a person while also having high expectations and motivating and effectively training their teams, while some other managers are stuck in the 60s and treat their employees like second-rate people yelling at them and belittling them. The second is more common the closer you are to manufacturing. While some groups are top-notch and working there can be incredibly rewarding, some other groups I would not recommend anybody to work in.Good benefits, challenging workMany meetings that make work-life balance challengingExperience depends on the groupWhen I first started I was miserable and almost quit. Then I changed teams and now it's the best job I've ever had.The structure changes on a regular basis. It's hard to keep track of the org announcements so don't get too comfortableGreat companyThe pay is not exactly what I’d expect for my position but the overall benefits package is great. Love that they offer paid maternity leave. I also feel cared for as a person, my needs are respected and I can take PTO easily when I need a break, vacation, or mental health day.I also get a lot of freedom to determine my schedule and have a say in which projects are prioritized.Good benefits packageStock and pay are less than what you see at comparable companiesLoved my job at intelLeft intel to relocate for family. Great place to work. Great benefits, 401k, paid holidays. I have taken the knowledge learned in water treatment to note larger scale. Thank youWalk walk walkFinding tools tondo your job is tough. They are broken, missing and misplaced. So you have to walk aimlessly around the factory for miles between toolboxes and if you hit the lottery, you just might find a good screwdriver to use. Management is aware but does nothing to replace tools and still expects performance. Training is like read the specs, and you might figure it out. Tenured techs treat you like fools and expect you to know a task as if you have done it 20! years. There is no parts control. Dangerous to walk around equipment without tripping on something. So be prepared to do 10000 steps a night .Excellent work environmentNice office decoration, large cafeteria with various dishes that suit every need, and recreational facilities. How work turns out for you may vary across departments, but my team has been one of the best and dedicated, full of people willing to support me with anything. Intel's culture teaches people how to behave well in the workplace, and protects them from malicious and toxic behaviors.Work environment, culturereduced benefitsBest Place to Burn OutThis applies to the intel technology development hub in Hillsboro, OR. Intel management turn over is quick, and company culture dictates individual contributors work extended hours. Employee job performance ratings follow a set distribution (i.e. a few must be rated poor, a majority mediocre, and a few outstanding). This leads to coworker back-biting around performance review time, and best-of-luck if your manager doesn’t like you. It’s a big company with a high burnout rate. They offer pool tables and foosball tables in buildings, yet nobody has time to play! Brilliant people work at intel, so smart people will love being burnt-out there, and can commiserate and drink away their complaints during the drunken team-builders. A few local bars were founded by ex-intel employees, if that means anything. Go in expecting to help change the world, leave with 2 brain cells and bragging rights for escaping the marriage between Skynet and the Empire!Seems disorganizedI enjoy working here and the people I work with are great. I even like the compressed schedule even though the 4th day can be rough.The only thing is there is a high turnover rate in management.Productive, uplifting, encouraging, excellent place to work.Intel in my opinion is the best place to work. They have outstanding benefits. Everyone is very positive. Management I've heard is hit or miss but better nowadays. I lucked out and have the best manager ever. The culture in a social environment recently changed due to social distancing. But in a training/1on1 scenario people will train the person how they learn. 10/10.3-4 days off per week, Friendly community, Career growth opportunities, Health care, cafes, gyms, game rooms.Long days174Great place to work (yourself to death)Expectation is that you work all the time to handle a constantly increasing and often senseless workload. Wellness days are offered, but you had better not use them. Same for nights, weekends, and holidays. You have to set quarterly goals for deliverables outside your main job and then you are set up to fail to be able to achieve them. Management and division shakeups have introduced chaos as leadership freaks out over the tanking stock price. Traditionally a good place to work and learn if you are driven, but quality of vision and leadership has fallen and the effects are felt at every level.badbad experience due to bad management, no working life balance, stressful everyday, management only know how to kick the ball to everybody else, worthless managementPoor road map and no proper deadlinesgood - perfect wlb, pay is good, good work culturebad - management is very poor and no career growth. Stock prices decline rapidly and missed revenuesgood place to begood flexibility, work from hope option, lot of teams, good support from management, good bonus, stable job, good work culture, lot of resources to learn.It's a grinderThey'll suck the life out of you and take every hour if you let them. Little respect for work-life balance - you're viewed as ""weak"" if you value the ""life"" part. Talented work force, too driven for their own good. Managerial tools encourage climbing on the backs of your peers.Great place to workCulture is great. Great work life balance, benefits, and challenging. Pay is average compared to competitors and with tsmc opening up in north Phoenix, Intel will need to up their salary to stay competitive. Overall great place to work.An all-star workforceI have worked for a number of very large companies. I can say that Intel had the most talented and intelligent workforce I came across. The average person at Intel would be an all star at most companies. It can be a stressful environment at times and sometimes suffers from the same maladies found in all corporate bureaucracies. But I was grateful for my nearly seven years there.Safe, great team, and great benefitsThe focus here is definitely on safety but the people I work with everyday are great. There isn't a person who I have met that I don't like. Also the benefits are great, between the healthcare, 401k, employee stock, sabbaticals and so many more i almost couldn't imagine wanting to work anywhere else.ExcellentNice place to work. Nice Perks. Fun time. Clean environment. Benefits are good and fun. Good office building. Great air-conditioning. Good facilities.Good job, but needs management regime changeGood job with good benefits, but didn’t feel very supported as a Manufacturing Equipment Technician from my Management team. Work culture is in need of serious changes for company growth to succeed. High turnover rate currentlyFun, Learn, but SlowIntel has a great sense of teamworks and is able to provide a space for intern to slowly but surely join a team head first in their projects. There are many processes that are slow and take a long time to get approved etc due to constraints within departments.Great place to workGreat place to work. Fun while learning if you find a good team to work with.Rewarding and encouraging. Very good health insurance and benefits. Internal award systems on top of compensation. Long daysGreatIntern. No complaints. I enjoyed seeing the people and lunch breaks with them. The people that work here are truly amazing and full of knowledge. I was star struckGreat pay. The people are really dry though.The pay and benefits are great. The people who work at Intel are EXTREMELY dry and unimpressed with everything and everyone around them. They will rarely crack jokes, smile or goof around. Other than that… it’s alright.Great place to work. Lots of OTGood life balance and lots of OT If you need money. Traning is provided on the job and training is about 6 months before you are on you own. Good luck.Intel - A Great Place To WorkI’ve only been with Intel for 3 weeks now, but the overall experience has been superb. My viewpoints are derived from my experiences with the Corporate Services - Electrical Team. Everyone I have had the pleasure of working with has been great, the team I am a part of is one of the best mashups of skillsets I have ever been a part of in my career. So much to learn to keep you competitive in your area of expertise and plenty of fringe benefits or employee perks to keep you engaged. I would absolutely recommend working at Intel, so far it seems like a fantastic place to work and grow professionally. Good luck!The hardest part job, hard place to work atWas trying to understand management, when then there a downturn how there reaction to situations. Can’t say lot some mangers work ok, but far and between. I had good ones and some really bad ones.Just flip a coin.Teamwork people work hard together!Healthcare changes every year!Great work life balanceGood Company to work forWith good work life balanceLot of projects to handleNot many Product Management JobsPeople not familiar with PM roles and responsibilitiesIt all depends on your department/managerHave switched between two jobs internally, but also many different managers.They finally focused on paying us what they should be which is great, but money is not worth it with some managers.With jobs that need to support 24x7 factories and high impact products, work load is very intense and hours can be very intense.With the added focus of cutting costs, teams ended up understaffed a lot. To the point, where I am currently on a severely understaffed team with no option to backfill the roles for people who have been leaving.When I had a good manager, they found ways to balance all of this without putting too much on the engineers. With the bad managers, it all ends up with pushing the engineers until many start looking for new jobs.As for why it depends on department, when working in factory training was great and well documented. It was easy to know what to do and how to do it (politics were a nightmare though). Current department, training is awful, no documents to find, and can be very hard to find the resources need to do your work.Good place to work with great benefitsIntel is a good place to work. Great benefits, maternity leave is 24 weeks, and stock options are a huge perk. Additionally get quarterly and annual bonuses."
WarnerMedia,"Never ending mergers and plenty of work. Technology is top notch.It's not a bad place to work if you like to stay busy. Days, weeks and months go by quickly due to the amount of work. Stand your ground on your personal boundaries when it comes to needing your own downtime. I really like working with my own team, but I guess that varies from team to team. Benefits are average, not horrible. The 401k match is decent. I have no problems requesting time off. We're always merging and going through headcount reduction so this can be very stressful. I feel we use some of the best technology so that's where I get most of my joy working here.Strong well-organized companyWarner Media is a well-organized and highly effective company that treats employees very well. It is a fast paced challenging environment where results are rewardedFun team and environmentCool shows. Great team. Lots of opportunities to learn. Management can be helpful if you build relationships early on. Good company culture, although it’s changing some with the newest merger.Don’t work hereThey don’t take interest in developing talent especially the Albany,NY now Schenectady office. Certain managers are petty and vindictive . If they fire all the managers and start over it might be decent. I’m a manager and learned what not to do by working thereFun workplaceEnjoyed my time here. I was challenged to grow and I learned a lot. My coworkers were encouraging as we were all working toward the same goal. Good entertainment experience.Good company, but not the same as beforeWas a great culture at Turner prior to the AT&T purchase, then went downhill and is only getting worse with the Discovery merger. No one is really sure what the company stands for, which is a shame when it was such a pioneer.Great WLB, but boringThe company now has unlimited PTO, which is great. You can also work remotely or have a hybrid work schedule, depending on the team you’re in. The only downside that I can think of is the possibility of being laid off, especially with all these mergers. Things don’t seem stable at times.bad managementhorrible management, annoying supervisors and coworkers, poor pay, no advancement. A typical day working security for this company is being talked down by a supervisorFun place to work inyou login and start your day, no supervisor is on your head or manager as long as you do your job.Execellent environement ., fun, and good salary overallgood salaryhard to get promotedExpect to be laid offSince 2016 the company has been laying people off and was just purchased by yet another company so there are sure to be more layoffs. The only people that get training here are the Executives, there is no job related training available. When I first started working there it was a wonderful place to work, but the culture quickly went downhill after 2016. All of the cuts made were to employee programs and perks.Sales Associate job- good part time job with some setbacks and challenges and overall interesting and fun environment.Overall it was a good part time job and I would recommend it as a seasonal job or temporary job but not long term. Long hours. Minimal opportunity for advancement. Plenty of interesting things to learn if you love film. Overall decent experience.It is by far the worst job I have ever worked atWhen I signed on with Warner Media I thought I was signing on for a technical job. System Administrator. This was not the case. This job is 95% not technical. The position is basically a high paid ticket jockey. Traffic director. It is very desctructive for a persons career. Warner Media highers high level engineers with a very strong technical backround to be traffic directors. I felt so lied to 3 months after being hired when I realized I was going to stuck at a dead end position that would actually decay my technical skills due to not using them at all on a day to day basis.cool campus/people, but disconnected teams/managementPROS: The Atlanta campus is great. It feels like a small but nice college campus. The culture was good in general. The company is trying (for the most part) to stay modern in their technology which I appreciated.CONS: Teams and management seemed a little disconnected in places. The organization is a hodgepodge of older acquired brands and they're still trying to organize it all.productive and fun with several outlets to relax and enjoy your shift.I’ve never had a better place to work at. The company allows for growth and internal promotions. Most departments are culturally diverse and management doesn’t overstep their authority.Great company to work for if your in the right department.At face value is is one of the top media companies in the world. Depending on what department you work in. The Security department can be stressful, and very demanding. You are glued to the company cell phone, and dare you not miss a call or email. All in all there are other positions within the company where people seem to be very happy at work. But do not join the security department, unless you don’t want or have a normal life. More work, less pay. If your into journalism, or movies, then it’s the place for you.3 weeks vacationDon’t expect to have a personal life.Toxic Workplace CultureToxic workplace culture, shady management, the typical terrible corporate world where you're in a room filled with entitlement. The need to make their workers feel appreciated and stop feeling out of touch.Free lunch, decent payMicromanaging workers, unreliable HR, nepotism, bosses who don't careGreat place to work if you can keep up. If not, this is not the place for everyone.Overall, working at WarnerMedia takes dedication and sacrifice to help the company expand. If you are early in your career and you want to go go go, this is the place for you. Not saying this is not the place for mid or late careers, the environment is incredibly fast-paced and there's no room to take things slow or even to fix old issues.Benefits, Pay, Inclusive Culture, Media perks, Great people, Unlimited PTO, Ability to travel to various corporate offices around the U.S. and the world.Remote onboarding was a mess, lots of tools to master, processes are not documented well, management can be demanding, worklife balance is not really practiced, long hours until work is done.Fun workplaceThe conundrum of WarnerMedia is that we are constantly changing (mergers, reorgs, spin offs), yet there is this inertia that makes it so that nothing ever really changes. Change gets really dragged out: It is clear most of us are never going back to the office yet execs are dragging their feet on pulling the trigger. It is clear our compensation has not kept in line with the labor market and half the staff has left, yet the execs are dragging their feet.It's fun to tell people where you work, pay is good at the beginningPay increases don't keep up with inflationBoring but goodThe pay is great and benefits are even better it’s just a very very boring job where you sit down in a shack for 8 hours checking IDs.Also no phones on person & uniform inspections before shift.Pay and BenefitsStrict policies, no advancementGreat brand name and companyEverything here is great if you can get in . This is a great company with alot of perks and benefits. Make sure that you are able to blend in with the culture and create a sense of belonging within the company. Gain mentorship when you can.Fun company, a little hard to advanceSuper fun company with lots of perks.The people are amazing as well. I think it's a great place to start your career or end your career. But if you're ambitious, it's a bit hard to move around and explore within the company.

But you had the opportunity for overtime by helping other crews outGood compensation and benefitsThe work I do is not very conducive for remote/work from home.

Management can be indecisive and opportunities for advancement are few.Great Place to work butWarnermedia is a great place to work but job security is not a thing here, You have to network in the company and brown nose a lot or else your job may not last. So many changes that you can't keep up with them.Flexiblity and benefitslack of job security with all of the reorganizations taking placeSolid Jobi like it here because there's a generally good work-life balance although being so large lots of expectations from its employees. might not be for everyoneOkay jobIt/s been many years since I worked here, the management only cared about numbers and time, they would schedule your appointments from 8-10 then have a team meeting at 8 and expect you to make times. Could be different now. They also used to fire people for pretty much anything.Free cableEasy to loose your jobCompany always changing and people get laid off all the time with no notice.I was laid off because we hired a new department head. While the severance package is very fair, it was a big surprise to learn I was fired. There was no assistance in repositioning me.

I met fun people and some of the managers were fine. Honestly, my work ethic went from okay to poor once I had done the exact same thing for a long time. Opportunities did exist for promotion did exist, but it was seldom and the offices were small enough to seem like it was a matter of ""who's turn"" it was versus getting a fair chance. Attendance policy is strict and most of the people were let go for attendance as the number one reason for turnover. you are a number and a means to achieve stats and nothing more. Employees had to often cheat to meet metrics, but no one ever openly talked about this for obvious reasons. You could save up a lot of sick time, but it was more for FMLA, because if you actually got sick and had to use Sick Leave and it wasn't for FMLA or Short Term disability, you would be fired. Even though I worked in technical support, sales were required to be done for 1% of all of your work.Great benefits, hour lunch, paid vacation, sick leave, fun work culture at moments, affordable healthcare insurance, free cable, internet, and TV, commission payManagement seemed out of touch, strict attendance policy, employees had to cut corners to meet metricsStressful, not worth the considerable money.That's right.

With Covid, it's become harder to stay connected with colleagues, but the company has made strides to fix the disconnect. My issue with the company is promoting from within.

They did the best they could when Covid came and kept me as long as possible. What was expected of me was clearly laid out and I could always ask for help if needed.

PerBlue,"Jerked AroundBeware of the hiring process here. They are difficult to communicate with, do not answer your emails, questions, or inform you of the process. Felt like I was stringed along and got my hopes up. Very unprofessional communication, couldn't even send an email during working hours.

"Baker Tilly US, LLP","There's a lot of opportunity, a friendly team, and nice benefits, work/life balance can be a challengeIt's an overall good company to work for. Ability to work remotely is nice, the benefits are fantastic, and there is a lot of room for advancement. It is still a public accounting firm, so you need to expect long hours during tax season and around deadlines during the summer.Not clearWhen I originally got this job, it was misleading on what I was to do. In the end I really couldn't do the right job because there was no training. I was very disappointed at what I thought I knew and the lack of training and all of my classes for taxes I was unaware of the information to do the job. I have never dine anything like that in dealing with s corporations and so forth. Of all the information I retained this was the area I needed more information on.Work at homeNeed more trainingGood peopleThere are good people to work with and the support group is good. Like any other public accounting firm, busy seasons are busy. Fringe benefits are decent.Poor Management.The company is adequate. The teams are fine. The managers not so much. I take pride in my work and find it very satisfying. It is too bad that there is no LMS tool for how to work with a bad manager. They should leave you alone and allow you to do your work instead of harassing youEnjoyed before pandemicEnjoyed working here before the pandemic, but they were not able to easily navigate training through this time and it ended up affecting me in a negative way so I moved on.This is an employee first environmentBakerTilly takes care of its employees in every way. From implementing “disconnect “ days (additional paid days off, like the day after the super bowl), to having your back if you get sick. Their HR dept went above and beyond when I was hospitalized for two weeks with covid and took months to recover.Great benefits, flexible work schedule, great work environmentTerrible would not recommendLeft a Big 4 firm to join BT as a Senior Associate. This place is a joke. Staff are barely trained, managers are spread too thin and half of them aren't trained enough on management and presentation. BT bought too many regional firms within a short amount of time without investing in bringing these offices up to national level and it shows in a big way. Quality of returns were absolute garbage. This place was a volume house if I ever saw one. Office culture very based on favoritism instead of actual performance.Would not recommend.Good benefits, employee perks but compensation lackingCompensation doesn’t seem to be fairly considered, great employee perks & benefits though such as pto policy, etc. which keeps me staying here. Good morale too.Good people and fun work culturePros:Summer Fridays and various firm holidays offGood cultureGood benefits,Random care packages with goodies,401K is decentCons:Typical public accounting - long hoursOutdated systemsAccountantOkay place to work overall. The benefits are good. Vacation time was generous and they celebrated birthdays with cupcakes. The office is also right next to penn station.Growth mentalityBaker Tilley is growing rapidly and they acquired my accounting firm where the morale was really high. I don't know much about the other divisions, but morale stayed reasonably high at my division.Management respectful of employeesWork is remote so knowledge of internet and software technology is necessary, Fast paced and intense work. Need to be able to self-discipline and complete tasks in timely manner.Great Company, Compensation Could Be BetterLoved who I worked with while at Baker Tilly. All of my clients seemed to enjoy our teams working on sight. Busy seasons seemed to be a bit much given staffing on teams being on the lighter side, and compensation didn't seem to align with the work load.Culture, People.CompensationCould be betterCould be better. Depends on office location. Too many mergers to keep up with streamlining processes. Management acts awful if they are jealous of you, etc.Great company with flexible working environmentI like working at Baker Tilly, I feel like the company continuously tries to improve as the workforce keeps changing in 2022 and I appreciate the amount of flexibility the firm gives each team to both live and work!Will take advantage of anyone will to over workThey have no problem running you into the ground and disposing of you when you start asking for support or help. Leadership will take advantage of you and disrespect you. Apparently unlimited PTO isn't actually to be used; I had taken only 1 partial week during the year (they still expected me to check in during this time off), and when I needed more time for a sick family member they said I couldn't take it or could either go unpaid or leave the company.... Not a lot of support for an individual who had always had good reviews and been a consistently high performer.Culture still struggling with race; promotions not always performance based but social.Great company culture, but a lot of it depends on your manager and department.Baker Tilly acquired the firm where I used to work. I stayed on board with my old department for almost 2 years before transitioning into a different department. The new department was core to BT and not an acquisition. I will say that the experience was night and day. My old department struggled to blend in with BT because they struggled with changes and updates (ie: remote work, casual dress, supporting staff when work-life balance was challenged, etc.). I was tempted to look elsewhere but wanted to look internally first. I am very glad that I did. The issues I had with my prior department were only because that team's management struggled to adapt to a more progressive business model. Once I integrated into a core BT department, I felt like I belonged and that I was supported. It was like I went from working in the 1960s to working in the 21st century. Major improvement and I'm so glad I gave it another chance. My only negative in the transition is that, while my pay went up when I moved departments, I went from salary to hourly and lost my unlimited PTO benefit. However, the PTO accrual has been relatively standard compared to other companies, so it's not bad - just a change.Great culture, competitive pay and benefits, flexible schedules, unlimited PTO program for salaried employees, remote workGrowing Pains with new acquisitions, no unlimited PTO for hourly employeesProductive and supportive workplace that makes sure you are confident in your work while maintaining good work relationships in and out of the office.I started working at Baker Tilly right before the pandemic began and I had several coworkers go above and beyond to help my training excel even though we became fully remote. Through the past few years of being here, I have made great connections in the firm as well as outside the firm. Baker Tilly has taught me that I can be successful and have given me several resources to maintain my health (mentally, emotionally, and physically).Team bonding during peak season and fulfilling open enrollment kits, office gatherings (safely of course), free lunches every now and then, good benefits, community volunteering as groupCommunication lacks occasionally which makes for more work on your end.Excelente lugar para ganar experienciaSe tiene constante interacción con los clientes, no hay un día igual al otroSe crece rápido profesionalmenteNo se tienen prestacionesWork hard but not overly excessive, great environmentEasier busy seasons compared to other large accounting firmsGood workplace cultural - seniors/managers are very helpfulHardest part of my job - boring 1040sReally enjoyable people working thereNice workplace, good expereinceLong hours, 1040s get boringGood place to workNice coworkers but very heavy workload.

Ability to work remotely is nice, the benefits are fantastic, and there is a lot of room for advancement. It is still a public accounting firm, so you need to expect long hours during tax season and around deadlines during the summer.Good company to work for.Everyone is pretty welcoming, i came on in the start of the pandemic and did most of my training from home after only being in office 3 weeks total. Overall it’s a good place to work.Working remote during covid or if you’re not feeling well.Fun workplaceBaker Tilly is a great place to learn and network. Many different experiences and like-minded people who are willing to put in the effort to have a successful team.They are always doing things for their employees!I worked at BT as a seasonal employee, but you wouldn't have known it. They treated me like I was a regular full time employee. They periodically send all their employees different goodies, and are always doing things for them. At the beginning, I was sent a box full of treats, that also had little things like a massager, an eye mask you put into the fridge/freezer, all natural energy drinks, and tea. They even do cooler things for regular employees like Happy Hour Fridays, where they let you off to go get food and drinks. During Covid, they were very understanding and asked people how they were feeling about coming back to the offices. I would recommend working for them for sure!Lots of extras, flexibilityGreat for public accountingWork life balance is not bad. Can be stressful at times. Handled Covid well. Very flexible. Cares about employees and lets them know. Manager could use training sometimes.ManagementOffices are different, but in my office managers do not want you to succeed and are too busy doing nothing to help. Working virtually works when people work as a team, but we don’t.Friendly and productive environmentI've had a great work experience in the company. There were some leniency but it wasn't bad. Wonderful management with lots of knowledge in their work. They addressed issues with decency and give chances to employees that tries.Free lunches, occasional treats, annual increase, off-day, free coffee and tea, etc.Low insurance plan, only 3 days sick leave in a year.Great company in a not-so-great industryI left Baker Tilly simply because I wanted to leave public accounting. As far as firms within the industry go, BT is hard to beat. I worked with great people who respected me as a person and championed me in terms of advancement.Personnel, atmosphereAbandoned structured PTO policy while I was thereGreat Experience overallEnjoyed my tenure at Baker Tilly. For the most part, you are recognized for your hard work and (pre-pandemic) compensation was very fair. Not a ton of work life balance. In audit, my busy season was 8 months out of the year, so the whole “off season is super light!” didn’t exist but I knew what I was signing up for. I learned a ton from really smart people and leadership was approachable and friendly (maybe that was unique to my midwest office?). Overall pleasant experience but happy to get out of the grind.Comp was fair pre-pandemic. Great partnersabsolutely no work life balance, but I signed up for that for good exit ops.Good Office CultureGood culture in the office. Busy season isn't too bad compared to larger firms. Employees are treated pretty well and the pay is pretty good. Good managers and partners.Tax seasonIf you are going to work in public accounting Baker Tilly is the best you’re going to get: high pay, flexible work schedule, 100% remote work, reasonable family Heath insurance cost, and great experience.Unlimited PTO, reasonable cost of family health insurance, unexpected gift boxes for family.It public accounting, you’re going to work a ton of hours.Poor atmosphere but great benefitsBaker Tilly truly does have amazing benefits, as compared to many other companies.The overall firm culture seems to be okay; however, the culture of my team is anything but toxic, and I dread working every day. If it weren’t for the pandemic, I’d be on my way out, as I can’t handle it much longer. I receive no guidance or help—no matter how much I ask for—and am then put down for not doing things correctly.I have also been berated by my partner—to the point that another team member complained to People Solutions—and nothing happened. It’s the Good Ole Boys club.BenefitsNo support, cultureDecent projects and work-life balance in consultingSmall/mid-sized consulting arm. Most projects are pretty interesting and not too hectic, unlike many other consulting firms. Manager/coach structure does introduce some ambiguity around advancement and accountability.Staffing Consultants keep in contact, follow up on progressCourteous consultant, contacted me directly, explained options and opportunities, prepared me for interview process and followed up to be sure the position would be a good fit.Clicky place to work. No diversity. No people of color work in the offices in Madison or Appleton WI, where I worked.CultureCollaboration with my colleagues at Baker Tilly was difficult. Most work not good in a team environment and preferred to work independently.OverallMy experience working at Baker Tilly I felt very alienated. The people on my team and other teams that I worked with were clicky, rude and opinionated.JobThere is pretty good job security as there is always plenty to remain busy with; however, the senior accountant position seems to bear the brunt of it at times.Company does not remove under performing employees which ends up falling to the seniors more times than not to pick up the additional or poorly performed tasks.No work life balance.One word - layoffsBaker Tilly prides itself on being one of the best places to work in several states, however they laid over 100 of their workers with the pandemic with no chance of recall. Those laid off had slaved away for them during the busy tax season, working tons of OT, to be rewarded with being let go and REPLACED by INTERNS. They don’t care about their people. They only care about their bottom line. Now the company is merging. Good luck. I can only promise there will be additional lay-offs!!! Stay away from this Company. They will lie to you, use you, and lay you off at their convenience.Free lunch on Saturday before the pandemicEverythingMy Experience rating dependent on ClientMy Baker Tilly Account managers were good at keeping in touch with me and exceptionally responsive to my concerns and suggestions. The bulk of my positive experience was that my Account executive placed me in the best (culturally) environment. I appreciated that the client accepted me as a member of the team. The hardest part of the job will be when my assignment ends (which will be soon). The most enjoyable part of the assignment was the opportunity to add to my skillset of knowledge.Deadline driven, fast pacedTypical large public accounting firm. Long hours during busy season (4 months), non-busy season still busy.Great place to begin your accounting career. You see in 1 year what an industry accountant might see in 3 years.flexible job schedulepublic accountingBaker TillyWork hard and play hard. Long hours during busy season extended into the summer but then things would calm down. Got to travel for work. Many little perks of the job.Excellent Company. ""Tone at the Top"" is Their Game Changer.Minneapolis Office is most likely one of the best, due to leadership in this office. I worked on the marketing team for years, and acting as a cornerstone to other industry sectors, was able to gauge the culture in other offices as well. In Minneapolis. you matter ...greatly. The Managing Partner is exceptional, followed by his partners and NBD leaders. The culture consists of smart strategic vision, inclusive of always moving and monitoring the firm, taking it to the next level. Clients are king and an employee's well being is critical. If you are considering this office for employment, I highly recommend it. ""Tone at the Top"" is what makes this office shine.Benefits, Bonuses, and the Trust Factor.Cannot think of any.There's a lot of opportunity, a friendly team, and nice benefits, work/life balance can be a challengeIt's an overall good company to work for.

It is still a public accounting firm, so you need to expect long hours during tax season and around deadlines during the summer.Buena empresaLos Contadores todos son unas personas muy amables y respetuosos, el presidente era una gran persona, el salario era promedio un poco bajo, y los incrementos no eran tan atractivos, ni constantes.La empresa maneja un buen ambiente de trabajo, sin embargo las oportunidades de crecimiento para mi área eran escasas, ya que mi carrera no iba enfocada en su giro, sin embargo un gran lugar de trabajo, las prestaciones son muy buenas, consideran al trabajador, y principalmente a los estudiantes.Variety of ExperienceBaker Tillery was the first Temp company worked for. The recruiters were efficient. Good Communicaton. I received a variety of Task from Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable.I was hired as part of the Baker Tilly (BT) Tax Prep Team at their Wilkes-Barre, PA location. I was informed the employment was seasonal (10 weeks)I only worked for Baker Tilly for about 8 weeks. All members of the BT Tax Prep team had their employment end on March 30, 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic.Free lunches on Saturday, work from home, respectful work cultureNonefun workplace with a ping pong tableIt was an awesome place to work and one perk I will miss was the open PTO. It was also a great place where co-workers were also part of your family. I was laid off due to COVID-19.Great Career Starting OpportunityWith any mid to large-sized accounting firms, the opportunities afforded to you at the start of your career are extensive, allowing employees early on in their career to take advantage of leadership opportunities, the ability to excel in technical knowledge. Also with a large firm, there are the benefits that allow for a fair work-life balance in regards to the public accounting profession.ProductiveGood work place environment. Plenty of resources available to further career and self growth within your field. Great introduction into other industries and client relationships.Good Learning ExperienceGood place to learn the fundamentals of public accounting. People who work there are smart and driven. You will work a lot of overtime and have to manage various set of priorities and specific manager styles. If you work hard and think on your feet, you will be successful. Hard to work if you have a family or other outside of work priorities.Free lunches, good health insurance coveragegood place to workgood place to work with flexible hours and scheduling. There are many part of accounting to working including payroll, taxcaition, counseling, training is availableTypical public accounting firm with long hoursBusy season basically all year long. 50 hours in the summer instead of typical 40. Not enough staff to work on returns. Culture not inclusive. High school vibes.Productive and fun workplace.I enjoyed working at Baker Tilly due to the team culture and challenging work. I was always learning something new and exciting and recommend the company for all levels of skill.Worked with them in the job replacement field.When working with Baker Tilly, work in the temp placement field. They were good at finding jobs when your current contract positions were ending. I would recommend working with them if trying to fine temp positions or full time jobs.Above Average RecruiterOnly got a few assignments but I was treated well and paid good. Their recruiters are very professional. They appear to have excellent base of local clientsPay. Good ClientsWaiting for assignmentsGreat in different departmentsI was very unsatisfied with my supervisor. While I did reach out to him, my peers, and HR, nothing was done. Instead, I felt undervalued and unappreciated.Good work environmentLong tax season hours but was not strict during non tax season months. I liked the partners and how they had an open door policy. They had a diverse work environment as well.YmmvExpectations vary a lot based on which consulting practice you are in...some will require long hour and or travel. Will be interesting to see how the new unlimited PTO policy plays outFriendly working environments peers are friendly and technical assistance provided when issues encounteredProgressively learn and growth from assurance assistant to assurance manager. Attended updated training based on latest and updated financial reporting standards.ProductiveI learn a lot of things related an audit process in different industries and the ways to talk with the clients to request the information needed to the audit. Also I learn about the structure that the CPA firms had.EHhhhIt was something else something new everyday hours are terrible you work like a dog the people are funny though but that’s not what makes the job to meNice place to work, good benefitsMy manager was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in teaching me what to do and how to do it. There were a lot of trainings and opportunities to advance my career there.Friendly environment with a focus on what really mattersBaker Tilly provides many options to learn while on the job, as well as donation and volunteer opportunities. The company at large follows their mission closely, however specific management is still growing."
XIFIN,"Good placeOverall they treat employees well. Greet employees with a smile even at 5 am in the morning on a Monday. Sometimes it was stressful, especially at the end of each month.Free sodas, coffee and tea. Bagels on Friday's was great.Healthcare was a little too high, supervisors were a little too extreme.Great work environmentThis is a great place to work but the pay could be better for all the things that are required to succeed in this job but overall I can’t say no many bad things about itFlexibilityPayGood place to learnVery nice place to learn. Working with coworkers as a team to accomplish metrics is always fun. Miscommunication or lacking answers to questions that employees have is not good. Training can and should be extended especially for people that are more life experienced.1A Bit Stressful at Times, Not enough necessary tools provided to be successful at the jobXIFIN has potential, however there are so many unknown answers when it comes to the IRT Billing Department. Great pay and schedule, however the commute and the morning traffic will frustrate you before you even start your shift. Then to get to the office and be even more frustrated, stressed sometimes, after communicating with rude patients.Employee PerksCommute Not enough necessary tools provided to be successful at the jobAR specialistThis has been the worst job I've had in my life. If you are currently working please don't quit and come here. No training, constantly demanding for projects to be done with no instructions. No communication and everyday you just feel lost.Bagels on MondayEverything is conExcellent place to workI've been here less than two years but so far my experience has been great! Schedules and management team are flexible and allow you to enjoy a work/life balance. There is constant room for growth and advancement and a sense of community even for remote employees which is difficult to obtain. Benefits are decent but could possibly offer more PTO.Room for growth, Competitive pay, flexible work time/location, sense of communityPTO benefits slightly lowIt's okThe job is easy, but the south Carolina office is very unorganized. Employees concerns are not being addressed. Office internet goes out and every other day.Easy, good scheduleUnorganized, no supportFun and Fast Growing CompanyXIFIN has created a great company culture where you can enjoy coming to work. Most of the people I worked with were pleasant to work with and willing to help answer you questions. Opportunities to move up were scarce and very competitive. Management cared about production but were willing to give feedback.Great company cultureStrict about breaks, clients were very demanding and rudeFun folks to work withFor the most part its been great working at Xifin. The CEO has a great outlook and what 2021 will look like. We are taking on more customers which means great things for the employeesFree lunch and snacks, team building, chance to move up or to different deptsPay, Schedule, Some of the managersBusyYou’ll be busy With no support from other departments. Your expected to help customers by delaying the inevitable- bad experience - good luck with managing stress levelSodahigh stressIntern opportunitiesAs an intern, I was challenged and respected. Lots of great people work here. Everyone was willing to help and I was given some exciting projects to work on.Great people, exciting atmosphere, lots of opportunity.Terrible job cultureWorked there for several years. I had not worked that hard and treated so poorly since working retail while going to school at night. I'm not kidding, the place has a minimum wage culture and the longer you work there, the worse it gets. The company wants qualified people but ignore things like turnover, upper management toxicity and how it affects the overall atmosphere of the place.The company has a great concept and marketplace niche, but has not been able too get to the next level due to workplace, culture incompetence and an inability to retain or develop the talent they have. The worst part is that upper management knows it and still regards the problem with contempt. The place is stuck in the 80s.The CEO is brilliant, but her management style is a bit autocratic. I think she needs to stay out of the day-to-day work culture, quit signing off, and questioning every little thing, so that decisions can be made without her oversight.Free bagels on friday and ping pong table you will never have time to use.Overall culture, hierarchical management style. Very top down.SatisfiedI've been around the block in this industry since 2004 from private practices, third-party billing to large hospital institutions and in my 2 years to now, Xifin has it right. The work is fast-paced, high-volume, complex and challenging so there is rarely a dull or easy day (which I appreciate) AND, this keeps the poser types that don't know anything or who are lazy out (they drown here and pretty quickly). The RS role is NOT for beginners. There is still some expected typical petty workplace drama, but little enough that it's usually avoidable. The the majority of time we are all too busy for that nonsense. Since Xifin writes and maintains their software, the other half of your job will include learning and understanding a lot of technical functions like automation, EDI, working in bulk, eligibility/claim status checks, etc. and how to tailor your customer's (lab) needs using these tools. Workplace attire is 100% casual, Einstein's bagels every Friday and we start as early as 6:00am (it was 5:00am before COVID) because at the end of the day, we want to go home after work! I've never been hassled about needing/taking time off or been conned into staying late; if anything everyone is waiting for the OT allowance to come back because we always have a ton to do. Xifin HR is offering meditation, yoga and exercise classes online since most of us are remote now as well and we have a fun committee that actually plans and does fun things! (birthday celebrations, outside of work events, games/contests for gift cards, etc). I am not usually one to trust businesses as most don't offerCasual attire/environment, early start hours, bagels on FridaysIt can be a bureaucracy to get things done working with other depts.Cr***y company to work for.Working at this company is not great, you are constantly asked to do things out of your description or added more work load without being asked. It is a hostile environment and basically need to kiss a** to grow and for a promotion. The management at this company only favors that type of person, it is not based on knowledge and will hold you back from moving to a different position and if you are lucky enough to be granted the privilege of changing departments, then they will delay the process as much as they can. The company is a joke.NoneEverything.Poor company leadership and Pathetic CultureThe company leader ship is extremely poor. You feel threatened when you work there. You can never advance. People are always brought in above you. Unfortunately, people are promoted not based on what they know but on how they conform to the oppressive culture. There are good people that work there but unfortunately they come and go quite quickly.In San DiegoSenior management is dictatorial, condescending and the overall culture is highly negative.Many excellent employees work hereThere is an overall lack of communication from upper mgt downward. New tools get rolled out with no announcement. Pluses are this company keeps up with the latest technologies.Unsupportive ManagementUnfortunately I have not had a pleasant experience working for XIFIN. This would be the reason for looking at other career opportunities. The Management team does not communicate important information that affects the customers overall satisfaction. The work environment is very hostile. I do not feel supported by my manager.Great companyI’ve been at XIFIN for a little over a year and very happy here. It’s like a family. The work is challenging but rewarding and I hope to be here for a long time.Everyone smiles on MondaysGreat place to work. Employees seem happy to be there. Very comfortable work environment. Hardest part is the reports. Most enjoyable is that they really care about the little things to make employees happy. Free soda and coffee. Free bagels every friday.OkPersonnel are great to work with. Benefits good. Systems are highly advanced. Department management underdeveloped and embattled. Office space very nice and modern. Staff turnover very high. Work with great people. No chance for advancement as upper management is routinely recruited externally and internal advancement is not promoted.People were great but management was a little behind the times.People were great but management was a little behind the times. Never had enough people to handle the work load. Only hire extra help long after it should have been done.Casual Friday and free donuts on FridayParking difficult sometimesGood placeOverall they treat employees well.

Bagels on Friday's was great.Healthcare was a little too high, supervisors were a little too extreme.Great company to work withGreat teammates and previous management was awesome as they will help you learn the systems. If you made a mistake my pervious manager will guide you in the system on where to get the correct information.1Do not recommend this companyDo not recommend this company. Please see glass door for a more thorough overview of this company. I would definitely steer clear from implementations and engineering.1""Retirement Home"" for morally bankrupt Tech ManagementThe most important thing to reflect on when considering whether you should work at Xifin is: Do you have a personal history of being slow to escape from an abusive relationship?While you may have significant skills or experience, these qualities are not highly valued at Xifin. Their engineering department has failed for years at retaining employees, and negative reviews keep piling up because they long ago stopped caring about their reputation.Xifin engineering managers are largely embittered over the company's failure to go public and make them all tech billionaires. They mostly despise and blame one other for this, and they haven't moved on to another company because they lost any interest in making an effort at their jobs roughly a decade ago. What unites them today is their desire to gain a feeling of superiority by projecting their feelings of anger, frustration, and inadequacy onto their employees. If you observe those who manage Xifin engineering you will witness some of the most juvenile and childishly unprofessional behavior you will ever see from adults this far along in their careers and their lives.Unfortunately, their attitude toward employees who don't quit within the first month is: by not leaving, you've proven that working at Xifin is the best that you can do for yourself in your life, and they are therefore righteous and justified in treating you worse as time goes on. The more abuse and mistreatment you put up with, the more they see you agreeing that their negative assessment is correct and that you're not qualified to work anywhere else.I have not witnessed any criminal or illegal behavior while working at Xifin.I did well but...My advice would be to not trust anyone. Agree with the employee who is closest to the top of the org chart. When confronted, blame shortfalls on the person no one likes. Try to go unnoticed.A typical day at workConsists of assisting and managing customers and accounts to maximize their revenue cycle; as well as service patients' needs with excellent customer service.It was a good stepping stoneThe job itself is okay. But management is unprofessional and you'll see no one stays there too long. The people are nice but management only looks out for those who are there friends or apart of there circle.Great CompanyWork is what you make it, I enjoyed working here and would definitely think about reapplying if I returned back to San Diego.They provide a healthy work environment and work with adapting protocols to help with ongoing changes.Hard to find good things to sayThe people here are running the company into the ground. Poor processes, no commitments between departments, and very top heavy. They do not pay anyone below a manager level well here, offer no training and no support with your job. I wasn't able to trust anyone I worked with here. Steer clear.Frendy, professional and relaxed work enviromentGreat place to work for, is a friendly and relaxed work environment, fast pace turnaround at completing your daily tasks. Must have initiative and be able to work with little to non supervision.Friendly enviroment, free baggels on friday, semi casual attireThe Best Revenue Cycle Solution for Laboratory BillingXifin is an industry leader for Revenue Cycle Management in the hospital / laboratory space. A typical day is busy communicating with key accounts to ensure their vision of success is being met.Professional office with respect for hard work., Ability to achieve work / life balance. Some of the nicest people you will ever work with.Opportunities for advancement are nonexistent, which is common for smaller departments.High stress environment with no growth opportunitiesA typical day consists of maintaining company proprietary software. There's no opportunity to grow your skill set, you're basically stuck doing the same thing everyday. Staffed with people who lack training for their job roles.Free bagel fridaysNo bonuses, no professional growthBlue faces and false friendlinessGreat product. Same management for 20 years. Stale. SMEs ""don't have time"" to train new people. PMs are way over-tasked. Too many high maintenance clients.Free sodasNo training or supportXifin reviewGood company.Busy call center. Most enjoyable part of job are the ""perks"". The biggest ""con"" if you are in the call center you there is really no ""down"" time during the day.bagels on Fridaysshort breaksTerribly managed, unorganized and unstable.Management does not care about the people, many live in fear for their jobs (there have been layoffs). No real process, lots of unnecessary work, finger pointing, arguments, raised voices.

Looking forward to growth in the years to come. There are some people that have poor attitudes and that can be hard.Like working at INITECHCore management hasn't changed in 20 years. Afraid of new processes and ideas. Hard to get help when you need it. Minimal holidays. Culture is work work work.Competitive salariesNightmaresGreat CompanyXifin is a great company to work for. You have to be a multi task and able to handle one than one lab. The hardest part appealing with medical record.I love the people and growth of the company.Challenging work loadNice group of people. A lot of work to do that makes the day pass by quickly. Could offer more training for new employees. No real area for advancement.Free coffee and sodaNo area for advancementGreat Place to workXIFIN is a great place to work. They listen to their employees and implement changes when feasible. The culture is improving and management is making changes in processes to make it a better place to work. There are some employees that have been around awhile that struggle with change but that is typical.Locker room with shower, free bagels on Friday, free soda, food trucks monthly, holiday and company eventswork load and pace can be a lot at times, but it does seem to ebb and flow so it balances out.Good placeOverall they treat employees well. Greet employees with a smile even at 5 am in the morning on a Monday. Sometimes it was stressful, especially at the end of each month.Free sodas, coffee and tea. Bagels on Friday's was great.Healthcare was a little too high, supervisors were a little too extreme..Good Company to work forI would recommend this company to work for, very understanding with their employees, they know employees have families and works with you to accommodate the needs of your family.A good place to work.Overall good place to work. It is what you make of it. I worked there during the early days, were long hours but the CEO took care of the original start up people. Would work there again.Good salary for certain positionsSmall company12Some people stay despite the toxicityWorked at xifin for almost 3 years and during that time saw people under qualified and under paid hired and placed in positions. Yet the hiring managers rave about them. Project Managers who cannot operate Excel or Outlook, product managers who do not understand the product and put the company at a disadvantage because they make promises that are difficult to keep and lastly employees who are not allowed to make decisions or change the antiquated processes, because there is no time.If this sounds like a company you would love working for and would allow your passion to take root, try dropping another xanax. The company has a toxic environment that is accepted and will not change.Hours are at minimum 8 - 5:30 with no telecommutingLeaders received their pay our already and are driving the workers into the groundNo real training/ unorganized companyBilling call center focused solely on metrics, did not care about the customers or resolving issues at all. Super stressful for anyone with a good work ethic as nothing could ever get done. I was only there for 2 weeks and trained by an employee who focused on telling off the supervisor. Asked both questions and received completely different answers. Felt as though the supervisor had no say or control of the department. Also noticed many other reps being rude and negative on the phone.Drinks (soda, coffee, water) were free. Free Friday bagelsUnorganized, rude to patients, no upper management controlHigh stress, low resources, micro-managed.Generally nice people running a profitable business by shortcutting and cutting costs Salaries were good but sometimes no amount of money is worth the stress and anxiety.Morale was low, gossip was high and deadlines were tight.Once a startup, always a start upXIFIN has been trying to grow beyond it self for over 16 years, yet does not change leadership or practices.They are a jump at the next opportunity, no matter the business cost or return. They disregard new practices brought in by new leadership and continue to promote for tenure rather than delivered results.And they wonder why they cannot deliver for their customers...Free sodas and candyUnpredictable goals, risk mitigation is ignored and continued pain for existing processesBusy and unorganizedI currently work in the call center and it gets really busy on Mondays and Tuesdays nonstop calls all day. Each day I learn how to handle difficult calls as we get a lot of patient grievance calls due to missinformation provided to them. It does get stressful at times but I manage to get through the day. I believe managment should have more control of employees, I know they shouldn't babysit us but it is unfair for some to do more work than others. My department is very small and I enjoy working with them, however, I do not like that some take advantage of the manager and tell lies in regards to low production. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry patients because they can be very disrespectful at times, however, I have learned to not take it personal. The most enjoyable part of my job is that each day I learn more about outpatient billing.benefitsshort breaksVery friendly enviroment and understandingAwesome place to work. Great enviroment, friendly people and an overall great company. The management team and HR are awesome. My grandmother recently passed and as a new employee they were totally understanding about the time I neede to take off. Thank you Xifin.XifinGreat product terrible place to work. You are taught to lie to customers and to sell a high level of service that can't be met due to the lack of caring from management. I would advise if you are contacted by a recruiter about a job to hang up the phone. I resigned and my clients were told I was fired. What a professional group of idiots.Some good people work there.Some people don't know what they are doing.Not what I expected* No SOP's*No Training on their own system, it was a learn as you go. Sink or swim*Very unprofessional managementno training, unprofessional managementVery busy but laid backThe late shift does not have as much work to preform as the earlier shifts do, which at times means that you don't have anything to do. The management team was very informative and very willing to share information and knowledge.Bagels on FridayLate shiftunder paid, under appreciatedWhile i did actually learn quite a bit during my short stay with Xifin, being pushed out after receiving exemplary remarks on my one and only performance evaluation by everyone who observed the presentation except my direct supervisor, who was absent from the evaluation doesn't make sense. It begins to look suspicious when it just so happens that i was just about to request FMLA due to a potential and eventually actual serious health concern when I'm told ""it's just not working out"" and how ""I'm not advancing as quickly as I should be at the 5 month point."" Again, this coming after exemplary marks on my one and only performance evaluation. This is not sour grapes but rather a cautionary tale to others. Xifin under pays and then expects exorbitant production and commitment. It was rare that i left the office before 7pm and was expected there by 8am at the latest. If we had an east coast customer then we were expected to be on their time, so 8am EST meant 5am PST, which in and of itself wouldn't be outrageous, but then still not getting out of the office until 7pm that night...once or twice, fine, but all the time? Like I said, they don't pay enough to hold those expectations. Management is like being in 2nd grade all over again, with a teachers pet, who can do no wrong, even when the client complains that she is doing wrong. Anyone who speaks out against the pet is admonished or instructed to fall in line or is mysteriously let go because he or she ""just wasn't working out."" The company offers no benefits above and beyond the standard healthcare, PTO and 401k (which of coursefree bagels on fridayeverything elseDifficult place to work due to the type of workMedical collections for company that does not have contracts with the large insurance companies and refuse to allow us to get prior auths is a difficult task indeed.good professional environmentnot tolerant of personal issues, expectations very stringentTypical dayAnalyzing data to create better efficiencies and work flow processes is the foundation of my position with XIFIN. I create standard operation procedure (SOP) for each area and function in the billing department. The standard operating procedures act as a working document for the staff to use as guide for their assigned task(s) or roles. XIFIN’s Billing Department is fast paced, constant changes and multiple exceptions due to the customer’s products. I have the responsibility and the most rewarding aspect of the function; to fully understand and create workable documents for the staff. The SOP documents must address all facets of the customer’s exceptions, and policy guidelines. The constant changes limit the time required to perform each request so the staff’s training and the fast response to updating or creating a new SOP is crucial to the success of the process. The staff and management rely heavily on the documentation as a resource to the system and /or system updates. The documents have dual purposes; the documents serve as resource and work flow each billing and revenue function.employees partners in resolving issues.time constraints"

If you work hard for them they will work as hard if not harder for you.Good work hoursGreat place to workCon-tech has opened many doors for me throughout the years. The company has changed mines along with my family life for the better! I am forever grateful for the wonderful opportunity.Hostile company for employeesHostile company for employees. Long hours for little pay for the work you do there. Have to work 65-70 hours to make any money. They get mad if you request a day off. If you enjoy being off work of having time home, this is not the place to be.Great, Purposeful Place to WorkFamily-owned company that promotes a safe, drama free, and productive workplace. Our core values of integrity, dignity, and respect can be seen in all areas of Con-Tech. Coworkers are great to work with, we support one another in accomplishing tasks and goals. Our communication is open, if I have a question I can pick up the phone and call someone. I am constantly learning new things and developing my skills. Management is direct and concise, the tasks I am given are clear and I feel heard when I ask questions or voice concerns. It can be hard busy work, but I find if you put in effort and dedication, Con-Tech is a rewarding and enjoyable place to work.Health Care, 401k, Pto, Holiday PayFantastic place to work, manufacturing great products for our great customersI have been working with Con-Tech for 9 years now as a parts and service sales associate, this was one of the best decisions I've made. Everyday brings new challenges that I look forward to accomplishing to ensure our customers are taken care of with the highest degree of service. This company has given me opportunities for advancement and I look forward to the continuous growth for myself and Con-Tech.Continuous growth & product developmentOverworked and undervaluedManagement is trying to grow business too fast and cut corners. Most every department and location is understaffed and experienced employees continue to leave because they are overworked and undervalues. I wish my prior coworkers the best of luck.Was a great company to work at in the past and had many competent, caring coworkers.I enjoy my job!This company cares about its employees and their families. Don’t get me wrong, they expect you to put the work in but they compensate fairly and offer extra rewards for going above and beyond. If you don’t mind putting in a good days work for good pay, this is the place for you!Daily Challenges Can be FrustratingIn this job, you will face new challenges every day. The more you do, the more is expected from you. It was frustrating to tackle new challenges daily. Avoid it if you don't want a life full of stress.A career, not a job.I began my career at Con-Tech through an Indeed posting several years ago and have never looked back. We work in a fast paced environment where doing your job well is rewarded. It is very encouraging to see how much the owners invest back into the company. Our facility has been under construction for expansions non stop since I have started working here. I am exited to see what the future holds.Advancement opportunities, Compensation4 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Job security, I know this company will continue to grow because we build high quality goods and everyone puts in 100%. When I started at Con-Tech over 3 years ago I was struggling in my personal and professional life but this job and my team has lifted me up in so many ways and things are so much better now for me and my family.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Trying to keep up with our rapid growth and striving to give our customers the best service and value possible. I am really working hard to move up and earn higher compensation and its is very stressful but I believe it will be worth my efforts.Challenge yourself and you will be rewardedThere are few companies anymore that make a product in the USA. And also reward hard workand dedication. Con-Tech Inc still hasall those values. When I started 3 years ago I had no knowledge of this industry. They put me on the factory floor so I could get hands on experience. It was challenging and hard work.But I gained so much more from the experience that it was worth the sweat and long hours. It is a small family company and you do feel like you or part of the family if you can put in the hard work. I am very happy to bewith Con-Tech and hope that I will be for a very long time.Pay, TravelGreat place to work, with great benefitsI have worked at Con-Tech Manufacturing for almost 2 years and my experience so far has been very positive. I am part of a great team and I like the fact that there's always a challenge ahead. I believe I've grown professionally since I started this position and seeing the growth we have experienced, there is no drought the future looks very bright. This is the first time that I have been paid weekly, this has been very helpful for my family. And one of the most impressive things about Con-Tech is the depth of experience of my colleagues. I know that I will continue to grow as professional and learn much more about the Heavy Truck Industry.Paid weekly, Medical and dental benefits, Team AtmosphereLong DaysSupport, Encouragement, and an Endless Fountain of KnowledgeI never feel ashamed to ask questions to anyone, the leadership team, sales team, and most other employees are always happy to share their knowledge and help educate. They are proud of their work and this company. Any project I am working on if I have a question, I can call almost any CTM employee and if they can't help me, they know who would be able to help! The job is challenging at times but I have received nothing but praise at the end of each project.Strong company growth and incredible job security for those who commit.I have worked at Con-Tech Manufacturing for over 3 years now. It has been an exciting experience to be a part of such a strong and rapidly growing company. Moreover being a part of such a committed team of professionals. I am used to challenging work environments and I believe this is the healthiest form of employment. There are long days but they are productive and fulfilling in nature which keeps me motivated to continue to push for more growth. I have interacted with many of the different teams within the company now and all seem very focused on the health and future of our company. Upper management is always asking for new ideas to help expand its product base, profitability, and quality of its goods. When you add all of this up I believe it is clear that Con-Tech is a fantastic place to work.I don't join them in their dramaThe environment was very unhealthy, all colleagues wanted to gossip and make some drama. They're so immature and it's really annoying. They hate me because I don't join them in their drama and gossip.Good place to work!Good environment to work, the days are pretty easygoing, You’ll learn plenty of things on the job, manager are respectful and willing to help. The job isn’t that hard, coming to work in itself is pretty enjoyable.1Worst year in my entire careerThis company has some of the worst leadership and management I've ever seen. You will work hard everyday and of course only your screw ups are noticed. Excessively long hours (70+ every week). Employees are working 5-6 days a week, lots of disgruntled people.I hardly might find just only one positive aspect to work in this corporation, and have tried many times, but I couldn't find it.25An unhealthy work environmentThe pandemic was mentally stressful enough that I couldn't stay with a job full of negativity and toxicity. From the management down to my colleagues, everyone was just so toxic, full of drama and gossiping. I always wondered if I was really in a professional workplace because it didn't feel like it. I'm glad I found a better job and I'm in a much better place now.15Low Pay But High WorkloadThe pay here was quite low while the workload was quite high. The expectations from each employee seemed to have no end. It was terrible. In the end, I quit, like many others before me.productive and funGreat company to work for, always learning and working with different people everyday. always looking for new challenges to learn more and advance within the company.Inexperienced ManagementHorrible working environment, they worry more about having a shipper who costs them money at every turn than an individual who makes them money. If you bring up these issues you are basically shunned until your final day. They lead by fear if you can call it leading at all. Also these issue are the same no matter the location your at in some cases they’re worse. Like the Ga branch, the Ohio branch, or DC.They allow you to go to medical appointmentsHealthcare, unfair pay, not adequately compensatedEncouraging environment always learning something newI was offered more than my asking wage, am able to work at a comfortable pace and free to do what I do best. Management is understanding when it comes to family and absences.Food, beverages and snacks available to keep employees energized and healthyToxic and demanding workI quickly left my job here even though I was getting along well with my colleagues because of the toxic and demanding work. I couldn't cope with working for 10-12 hours a day because I got kids to attend to. It wasn't a mother-friendly job to say the least because the job would demand almost all your attention and hours.Company goals over employeesThe work atmosphere was simply terrible. The management expected us to work long hours and over 50 hours a week. It was, has been, and will always be about company goals, not employees!I have nothing to report.Do More and MoreWith time, the expectations of the management from the employees also increase. The more you do, the more you will have to do in the future too. You will get exhausted if you work here for more than a few months.There isn't any opportunity to move upRead the rest of the reviews and it's easy to figure out the real issue with this company. Incompetent management, long hours, underpaid employees, PERIOD. They don't know how to treat employees. Most employees work at a minimum of 50 hours per week. They're set in their own ways & refuse to change the process even though it would improve getting things done. If you are looking to grow your career...RUN!!No respect for my workThe business by owned by a family. They don't appreciate the work done by laborers and often underpay them. I wanted more respect from the employer, so I chose to look for another job.Nothing I would like to add here.Do it even if it makes you work til late nightThe bosses are always on to you and is always rushing reports. When they needed something, it needs to be done on the same day and it doesn't matter how long it would take you. If you have to work overtime for it, even if it takes you til late night then do it.Wonderful AtmostphereThis job really makes you feel appreciated and part of a team. The nice thing is you get the chance to do different things everyday. This gives you chance to experience a lot of different things and learn.Family OwnedFast-Paced environmentWorking with outdated toolsTheir system changes from time to time without updating everyone about it. But despite that, we're still working with outdated tools and equipments which affects the productivity of our work.Fast Paced, High Functioning EnvironmentIf you are looking for a fast paced environment where every day brings a new and interesting challenge, Con-Tech is the place for you. Con-Tech is a family owned and operated business with a good sense of community within the company. Expectations are high for everyone, as excellence is an expectation, even when things need to happen fast. This is a good thing if you have a go getting personality, and creates an environment of fast turn around times and variety. Most importantly, the people running the company are compassionate and care deeply for their employees. However, as it should be, this is more evident once trust is built between management and yourself. If you come in with an attitude of things you deserve just for being there and doing the basics of your job, you wont get very far, but if you take care of the company, they will take care of you in a deep and profound way. Compensation is good even considering a relatively demanding schedule.Good Compensation, Family Atmosphere, Interesting workThe most honest review you’ll find here.First of all, if you enjoy working 50 hour a week but only getting paid for 40, this job is for you. Oh but you need to leave 10 minutes early to pick up your child? Guess you’ll have to use your PTO even though you’ve already put in over 40 hours! God forbid they just let you leave a few minutes early to have some sanity or spend time with you children. For a family owned business, they really don’t care about your family and your home life. They pride themselves on being family owned, but the work / home life balance is absolutely terrible. PTO? Yeah make sure you negotiate that before you start because you won’t get it your first year if you don’t, and you only get a few days of PTO! The hours are 7AM-5PM which makes for extremely long days for little pay and benefits. “Management” is a joke as they honestly have no idea what they are doing. If you aren’t one of the owners daughters, you don’t matter. They do whatever they want, come in whenever they feel like, “work” from home, take unlimited days off, and get treated like princesses while everyone else is forced to work 10 hour days 5 days a week in the office with no leeway. It’s impossible getting replies from management & half the time their emails look like they were written by a three year old with the amount of grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes, and use of english in general. It’s kind of embarrassing knowing that those people are talking to our customers and potential customers like that.At Con-Tech, you are replaceable and they are sure to let you know that. They don’t appreciate the amazing employees theyNice coworkersLong hours, negative environment, no PTO, management, mental health, work/home life balanceNo love for sales personnelSales decisions were made by people who have never sold a thing in their lives. They have no idea what incentivizes sales representatives to perform at high levels. In fact, they threaten their salespeople, even top performers, with reduced pay, termination and even suspensions.This company was concerned with one thing, moneyIf the company could put half the time into their employees as they did making the office look pretty and filling up their already full pockets with more money, they may have a shot at turning around this failing company. But this is doubtful. This company was concerned with one thing, money.There was no stability thereEntire departments were created and could be dissolved over very short period of time. There was no communication. Most employees have now been furloughed for months with absolutely no word of whether or not they have a job to go back to. They also been stripped of all benefits including 401K and health benefits.I was sworn and shouted at.I politely put in a two weeks notice and was sworn at and shouted at in front of the entire organization, they called repeatedly with threats. The management team should not be managers. Leaving the company was the best thing that ever happened to me. Do not quit a stable job to work for this company under any circumstances.Good place to work!Good environment to work, the days are pretty easygoing, You’ll learn plenty of things on the job, manager are respectful and willing to help. The job isn’t that hard, coming to work in itself is pretty enjoyable.1No trust and long hours while feel unappreciatedThere was so much turnover between me and the last “marketing girl” that I now honestly feel like I was hired to just fill the position. The hours are long, I started as a double for the front-desk admin without getting paid for that as well. As “marketing” I answered phone, managed promo inventory, while creating a 200+page catalog, and greeting everyone that walked through the door along with 19472x more tasks. All of this within my first week. You take on a lot and if you can’t handle it you’ll be replaced. They are growing and hopefully learning from mistakes. Sometimes I felt cared for and appreciated while other times you feel like nothing but a number. Manufacturing is their mindset. The pay is decent. You have to beg for a review or more compensation. I worked for this company for almost two years and I learned a lot but was treated very unfairly for speaking up for myself and my coworkers safety. There was no clear form of HR and management is very hard to get in touch with. I had watched many people get walked out the door at this company. If you’re young, there’s better places to be and you’ll find more support and value elsewhere. Though I met some amazing people and learned from them there is very little time to get to know your coworkers as there are cameras everywhere and you can’t be seen talking to a coworker for more than a second.PayManagement, hours, no trust32When we offer people positions whether in the office or in manufacturing we make sure they know the hours before they commit to the position. Thankfully you were only at the front desk for a short period of time before we were able to get an admin person hired to take over that role and responsibilities of the front desk. We have also gone from one marketing person to two so that the duties can be spread out and not get too overwhelming. For marketing, this position meets either weekly or every other week with their direct manager and during that time if there any issues they can be disgusted. If you're talking about the owners of the company and not being able to get in touch with them the proper protocol is to start with your manager and then the conversation can progress from there. We have made great strides in our company with who's in charge of the hiring process and making sure we are hiring people that not only will do a good job but will also be a good fit for the company. With this change, our retention is improving greatly.Long hours Bad PTO and managementLonng hours. Office staff is treated better then every one else. No coffee. No breaks unless lunch. You never hear from management. One time I remember we stood in the factory eating pizza for our Christmas dinner. The only good thing is the amount you make you put in long hours for it. Cameras every where. You are definitely just a number when you work here.Decent payManagement, work life balance, hours, the atmosphere23Doesn't compensate you wellThis position has more responsibilities than it says. You'll have to do accounting work and other general admin duties and tasks. Working here would make you sacrifice your personal time but the company doesn't compensate you well for it.Coworkers are good to work with though you don't have much time at work to get to know them well.Great AtmosphereGreat work atmosphere - teamwork is very strong here and everyone helps each other succeed. The only downfalls are long hours and lack of PTO. Other than that, the company is one of the best I have ever worked for and I would highly recommend working here.Health Insurance, Friendliness of employeesPto, HoursWhere ppl want to be the best at what they do.The people here take pride in there work and obviously work hard to produce the best mixer in the concrete mixer market.Most everyone is light hearted and have fun during the work day.The ""team mentality"" is very strong here and they encourage that sort of thinking in every dept.Its all about attitude. If you are looking for a place to coast out the rest of your existence in comfort and ease and do not intend on any future personal growth then this place is not for you.But if you have a desire to learn, work hard and kick butt, you will be rewarded- and have fun doing it.Its still a young company with lots of potential. Growing every year.Family focusedLonger hoursGreat people to work for!Con-Tech Manufacturing is a great place to work. Everyone is so helpful and friendly and they all work as a team. They are extremely customer focused and do their best in everything they do.Paid Health Insurance, PTO and Personal Day allowances, 401K Benefits, Great Facility10 hour days, Small amount of PTO for hours of work put inPart of a TeamAt Con-Tech I feel valued as an employee. My opinion matters. I work with my co-workers to find better and more efficient ways to carry out my work. We are constantly looking for ways to improve. Everyone is part of the team to work to make what we do continue to be great while looking for ways to improve our processes. I enjoy being busy with rewarding work and great co-workers.Healthcare/401KAmazing Place To WorkCon Tech is an awesome place to work. The ONLY downfalls is the PTO and personal day allowance for employee and the long shifts for office employees . Manufacturing gets 4-10 hour shifts and a half day on Friday. The office works every day 10 hours a day without otHealth InsurancePtoEfficient, productive, and holds high standardsI like that I always have something to do and the pace is incredibly fast. The company holds high standards for their employees, which is reflected in the final products and services that the customer receives.Growing company, diverse employees, high standards, flexible for my familyGreat place to workTop notch pay and the job is fairly easy if you like sales. Travel about 10 days a month and get to see customers in person as well as talking on the phone. Benefits are good, could be better.No investment in people or tools.Leadership was very hypocritical and ineffective. For the management, you are just a number. Hours are ridiculous, hope you are not expecting a personal life. There is no commitment to developing a better facility for the employees who do the hard work. Con-Tech Manufacturing is one of the worst work experiences I've ever had. No regrets on leaving.Every employee is only a numberThe place is essentially a sweat shop. They don't care about their employees and demonstrate it though their actions constantly. If you thrive in a toxic, unsafe, micro-managed environment, then this is the place for you.Good place to learn welding techniquesPlays the blame gameDon't you ever dare committing a mistake while working here cause even though it's not your fault, it will be your fault. The management likes to play the blame game a lot! They don't think there's anything wrong with the process or the system. Whatever went wrong will be the employees fault for being negligent, incompetent and just not fit.Sell Your Peace HereThese people pay you well but want you to sell your peace. Only join if you want money more than peace in life. You will be chasing sales numbers and impossible targets all the time. No learning and no personal growth.Unwanted PressureThere is unwanted pressure to perform if you work in Sales. The expectations keep on growing with time. After a while, it becomes hard to keep up, and people quit. I did the same, so I would recommend that you join only if you can work under extreme pressure.Friendly and a good place to work atI enjoyed working this company, the coworker was very helpful the employers was very nice to there employees over all I would go back if could, I enjoyed working for themNoNoHigh Pressure and Long Work TimeIncompetent management with poor decision making and doesn't care how you are treated. Too many rushed orders and hot projects, everything is last minute. They will pressure you to work overtime, but when you need to leave on time or need to leave early they will make it difficult to do so.Constantly learning new methods and how to use specialized tools.Go elsewhereThey are hard to please. Suceed if your family. Seem money hungry and don't care. Lot's of people letgo while I was there. Sort of live thinking youll lose your job. If you apply beg for more vacation time before you start. You don't get 10 days of til your there 4 yrs.Hours were Long and The Compensation was PoorUpper management really don't know which direction they want to go as far as how the day to day should be worked, but they want you to have a understanding of what is happening inside of the company. The hours were long and the compensation was poor.Professional yet lightIt is admirable how our management has set a light yet professional work environment for all of us. They are at the forefront in establishing a solid culture in place, which directly affects our mood, drive, and performance at work. I'm just grateful to have understanding leaders who are truly invested in our welfare as professionals.We may always be busy at Con-tech, but it is in a good kind of way. I continuously learn from it, because it's engaging. The experience sharpens my knowledge and skills. I'm glad to be a part of this innovative and progressive team! I couldn't be anywhere else.Good pay and benefits, Nice corporate cultureIt is usual to get busy. It is only a matter of effective time management."
RGA,"Laidback work environmentFlexible schedule. Benefits nothing to brag about. Employer contributes 7 percent to 401K if you have pension and 10% if no pension. Paid time off really goodGood pay, bad leadershipYou can't get help from anyone. It's super cliquey and few people are certified for their position. It's a super weird feeling there.They have a kitchen, and the food is pretty good though.Decent pay, good food in the kitchenbreaks are given as an obligation, and they'll ""side eye"" you for taking them.Local location closedIt’s was a good place to work that had potential to be a great place to work. Sadly we had a branch manager that didn’t care, and with only 1 salesman that didn’t care to work either they couldn’t keep enough business to make any money for the company. Inside sales/office manager was the main reason that the store remained open as long as it did!GREAT place to workRGA is a great place to work. Management is supportive of personal goals and advancement. The pay is very good and the benefits are incredible. The culture is supportive and inclusive.great management and supportnoneDoes most of the important things really wellIf you just want the most money then RGA is not likely going to be for you. Other than that, management is generally pretty good and cares about the employees. Benefits are good. Co-workers are smart and generally value teamwork.Overall good companyDecent pay, average healthcare, management is overall pretty good. However, there is a very old school culture there and they are very resistant to change.Flexibility, Pto, decent payManagement doesn't really care what employees wantDysfunctional corp comm and marketing departmentWhile there are some things to like with the RGA wor culture, there are a lot of problems as well. Specifically, Corp Comm and Marketing has a lot of dysfunction. Structurally, the way these areas are managed and ran is just obtuse, inefficient and mostly done for the ambitions of those leaders. Instead of a culture of collaboration and innovation, there is siloing and an air of political antagonism that the local leaders hope propels their careers. Operations and HR do not care to fix these areas with their known problems because they are ran and considered service departments instead of partners within the company. There are no clear career paths laid out in these areas and it causes high turnover and an overall lack of quality work. Potential employees should be leery of being used as pawns for the benefit of local leaders’ status and professional ambitions. The environment is not a positive one for creatives like writers, visual artists and producers.BenefitsNo career paths, slow change, clueless local leadershipI love it here!The only negative is growth. I know they're working on that, but it can be hard to see a path forward - especially if you're not the ""typical"" actuary.On-site cafeteria and gymOverall great, just not for meWhen I joined, I started with little to no experience. I have gained a lot of experience so far, however, the insurance business is not for me. I believe the people and work environment is great. I enjoy the team I work on and believe management is decent. Some things move slow as in any company, but I believe they are definitely open to change more often than not. Mostly, it comes down to budget and if the team/area has the money for things. Hardest part of the job was finding enjoyment/interest in the business of insurance.Flexibility, good pay, amazing benefitsNone really, just no interest in the insurance industry.Associate Claims ExaminerVery good work place and organization. Just stay away from operations. Work life balance is great, pay and benefits. Just try to avoid operations at all cost.Pay, Work Life BalanceManagement in ClaimsPay isn’t all there and hours are sometimes badCome into the shop find out what needs to be doneGood people to work with friendly and suchCorporate doesn’t seem to care about employeesDon’t pay for the amount of work they want done or anythingIt’s an esop companyHours, pay, etc.Great place to work with connected leadershipRGA is a great place to work - located in the Minneapolis Group Re office. Leadership all the way up the corporate execs are connected to the employees and looking for ways to build a purposeful culture. Good work life balance and lots of support provided during the pandemic uncertainty.Great place to work.Great place to work. Since the pandemic they are more tuned in with working from home. Office space is nice. Subsidize parking if you are downtown working. Great benefits.Remote workingUnderstaffed in my areaGreat company to work forNo advancement opportunities for nurses but plenty for other rules. Great bonus annually. Very good benefits. Caring and suportive culture. They really value their employees.Alright low payDon’t make enoughRaises minimal at bestEasy workDon’t expect to make good money anytime soon although they do hire within to nice office jobsFourExtremely Political EnvironmentRGA’s culture is rotten and the office politics are extreme.

I enjoyed my time there and fulfilled my obligationsGood, solid company to work for with many opportunities for advancementtypical 9 to 5 day with normal breaks, fun people to work with and great benefits. I held several different jobs throughout my time there, so I learned many different things about different aspects of the business. Management is good in some departments and not so good in others, and when I was there the managers were allowed to opt out of training classes that I, as a new supervisor, found very useful to help me manage my people. The lack of commitment and/or indifference to self-improvement on some managers' parts was disheartening and was evident in their management styles. The hardest part of the job was workload/time management and the constant push to meet exceedingly difficult goals. The most enjoyable part was the relationships I had with my co-workers. I made a lot of good friends over the years, many of whom I still talk to.Difficult to work with IT ManagementThis was possibly the worst job I've ever had. I drove 45 minutes each way to sit at a desk and twiddle my thumbs, beg for work, and was pretty much told I obviously didn't understand.My immediate supervisor couldn't make decisions on her own but looked to her manager to tell her what to do for everything. I'm a highly educated employee who has spent years in hands on IT and Management positions and I found it extremely uncomfortable to watch IT management throw temper tantrums because an employee made suggestions to fix things that the IT manager didn't agree with. The atmosphere is stifling and not conducive to success. As long as you do what your told and do not suggest any process improvements you'll be fine. I just couldn't continue to work for a department where employee input was viewed as a bad thing.Cafeteria, covered parkingdisfunctional managementGreat atmosphere, good music and very supportive managementi would check in with the MOD to see what had been already done, needs to be done and sales plan for the day/week. Most days i'd start my shift off with customer service, my shift usually started when there was heavy foot traffic. When things slowed down me and the MOD would focus on rearranging the stock or changing the visuals in the store to keep a fresh in style look. Those were always the things i enjoyed the most being that my managers gave me a lot of creative license, the worst part would probably just getting the store in shape for the next day; because in retail there is always a lot of folding, fixing, cleaning and reorganizing to do. Being able to connect my phone to play music in the store really made closing a breeze, plus i always had an awesome friendly coworker along side.30% discount, able to play music in store, family environment, flexible schedulehours being cutHard Work is Well-CompensatedRGA is a company of professionals who work hard and are well-compensated.

They accommodate me perfectly and I loved the Extra hours and the voluntary time off too.Cheap lunch area optionsShort breaksI wouldn’t if I were youLet me be clear by stating I worked at Amazon, one if their fulfillment centers here in Texas, and I would NOT recommend this company. Wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. At the time I was employed, I was desperate and it was a easy process of getting hired and placed in a position. Working from 6 pm to 6 am with $13/hr pay along with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break was for the birds. Also, if you’re off on your productivity or miss something on accident, just know there are no accidents or mistakes and someone from HR will come at you and ask you several questions. They want someone to be fast, like too fast. If you’re not fast, don’t do it. Don’t attempt it. If you need time off? Forget it. I don’t recommend working here. I know the pay looks tempting, but I promise it’s not worth it. You’re replaceable.NothingEverything.Unrealistic expectationsThe job is easy. However, the pay should be much more for the work that's done. Constantly working like a robot gets Annoying. Also, the shifts should be shorter like 8hrs and if you want OT than that should be optional. Lots of underhanded drama and gossip. I like that I work in my own station. But ppl still find a way to pick with you. Could use some fine tuning. Also, any promotion that comes with a vest should get more pay. Not just a vest. I'll be here until after new year then I'm leaving. Also, they should offer more PTO when hired. At least 24 hours instead of 10 which only covers 1 shift. There is no sick leave.N/aDrama, over worked & underpaid. Long hoursLaboriousGreat pay and benefits depending on the schedule you choose, but balancing my work/life balance was always difficult here.

The job training is pretty thorough when compared to other call centers, so I do have to give them that. There's also continual training as you work for Amazon. For the most part, working as a customer service associate at Amazon is a lot better than most companies. They allow you to help the customer a bit more than other customer service jobs do, so I see that as a huge plus when it comes to helping customers. Aside from that, the managers are very helpful and understanding for the most part. Most of your coworkers are also very helpful if you're new to the remote customer service world. There are tons of policies that you must adhere to, which for the most part is okay except they do change often. There's no issue in that other than the lack of updates sometimes when it comes to policy changes. You do find out about the policy changes eventually though, so that's good.1 starWhat is the best part of working at the company?Weekly payWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?No real organization no correlation nobody seems to no what there really doing and hr is never helpfulWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Robot is the cultureWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Un organized 11 to 1 hour break ratio not good at allGreat place to growI started working at Amazon in April and got my first advancement in August.

The only reason I'm still working for this job because I live in California and it's really hard to find a job outside of warehouse work anywhere here. There are better options than Amazon and I urge whoever reads this to really consider something else.You find friends that becomes family at the work placeMy only issue is that the HR on site are not well knowledgeable and also some worth not considerate towards your life hiccups.They keep sending you back and forth till you are frustrated.Ehhh…Honestly, working at Amazon isn’t good or bad. Most days you would have an okay day or a very bad day. It is very repetitive and can be boring. The 15 minute breaks wasn’t really 15 minutes because you had to take a long walk to get to the break room. By the time you get to the break room, you only have like 10 minutes left of your break.

But in a perfect world we definitely do not live in that won't happen. Do remember no on in there is your friend or will be your friend when you down and out. Do your best to learn how to finesse the TOT aspect of the job. Don't clock out early and don't use your unpaid time off to leave early. Use those hours when you're late to hour for whatever reason it is.Make your own scheduleDecent enough job. Work when I feel like it. Pay is ok, you get to see what you made prior before your check coming in.

Amazing healthcare, dental and vision. Your future is never ending with AmazonThanksgiving dinner. The managers doesn't care about you.I was initially was brought on through a temp agency then was on boarded, that was my first mistake. I originally was a picker but the constant bending to grab stuff was not sustainable and when the chance to transfer to another role presented itself I took it, that was my second big mistake. Every position is pretty hard and the pay doesn't match the work. I will never work there again.Great OpportunityWorked at Amazon for 6 months before leaving to move. They have amazing management all around, the pay is alright. It’s insanely difficult to reach and match their pick rate every single day. Everything is automated and data-driven. You’re your “own” manager, meet your tasks daily and you’ll love it.Though, even at $20.00/hr - The work to value isn’t exactly fair. Working for 10-12 hours with minimal breaks, I would think $22.50-$25.00/hr would be fair pay considering my job is paying me $20.00/hr to do a quarter of the work.Their PTO is quite amazing, you can come in late or leave early whenever you like. Attendance is based off a point system, use it as you like. If you run out, you’re out.Follow throughThere is a disconnect between employees, H.R. and Management. I enjoyed working at Amazon, but when it came to switching roles or moving up it was difficult. I quit because the flex shift was denied to me. The reason? I needed to be at the co. For 30 days. At the time I had the request, I had been at that location for 5 months and with Amazon 11 months. That is frustrating. But in a whole Amazon is a good place to work, and when I got covid you took care of me, so you are forgiven. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of your amazing company.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Great people.

Stressful, underpaid, and work life balance is terrible! I have seen people CRY at there desk, many if times due to this job. There was favoritism and lack of respect!Work life balance, there isn’t one. There was no room to move up. When you bring problems to management, they could care less and pretend to care! You 0… ZERO PTO starting. And you only got 4hrs a paycheck. You got NO Vacation or Sick time. Just PTO 4hrs a paycheck!!! It was ridiculous if you got sick and needed to go to the Doctors, had an emergency!The pay is low and pathetic, it was only when people started quitting did they even attempt to increase pay, per a former colleague there told me. And they lowballed them.This was the worst jobs I have ever worked and was thrilled to leave! And anyone wanting to work then, please think twice.Management, Work life, PayVery stressful environmentThis is a very stressful call volume, you are not set up to be successful. You are micromanaged, you can not even go to the bathroom without it affecting you. You are not given enough time to take personal days, god forbid you have a health issue with you or your kids. They say they offer incentives but they are never on the check. The metrics a super unrealistic especially for taking over 100 calls a day. PLEASE RUN FROM THIS PLACE!4The work and culture is great but their upper management and budget is notYou'll learn a lot here, the tech is pretty solid. Work is fair and busy, with a great culture. Unfortunately, positives end there. Upper management is volatile and fickle, moving teams around, laying off in large numbers and treat engineering as a cost. I cannot recommend this company in its current state, look elsewhereDecent payThe pay was decent after 90 days but call volume is ridiculous during peak season. Metric based system that was very hard to maintain and confused quite a lot.No trainingThey do not properly train you. 2 weeks of training (barely that) then you’re thrown to wolves basically. The pay is average. Great coworkers. Trainers were not helpfulThey dont care about the patients who call in about their bills.Training there is minimal. Getting patients to pay even when it shows they had insurance ٫ just not billed they still threaten or send them to collections. I had many elderly who paid 2x on their bill just so they wouldn't be sent to collections. Very very sad. They care more about getting money then helping the patients who had ins but just weren't billed than doing the right thing. I couldn't work for a company like that.Decent paydont care aboutNo training ride managementThis place will try to make you quit the day you start answering phones. They lie to you and say you will only take around 40 calls, but I have received well over 100 calls before.You are marked down on everything however no trading is provided so that you are able to improve next time.Remote, benefitsShort lunch, management, trainingPays well if you play the corporate gameI worked for Zotec for 9 years, management never cares about you, only the work you can produce and produce quickly.No advancement opportunities unless you are part of the ""cool kids"" club.Lack of managementThere was so much bad things about this job. The customers were okay. I learned alot of great things and got experience. The pay is good. But it all goes down hill in management. They will not communicate with you, they never answer. And you get little help.ive been lied to way too much. Blamed for their own system issues. And my God, you are expected to take calls in 2 minutes with no after call aux at all. Everyone complained about multiple issues and no one listened. Be aware. We get help through zoom and most of the time they don't actually know the answersPay, experienceShort breaks, lack of leadership, no communication, turnover rateProductive place to workThis place is great to work. Busy days Monday through Wednesday . Managers are great and the people who train are the best. Training could be a little more in depthWorking RemoteRight now we work remote . Team leads and managers are always available to answer questions. They have been voted top 10 places to work in Indiana for years now and they do deserve it .An okay place to workThis isn’t a bad gig. Compensation is decent for the job. Insurance is pretty good. The CEO and other higher-ups are great people.However, PTO absolutely sucks so don’t work here if you ever want to take a vacation or are going to ever be sick. The company does not give any vacation or sick time, only PTO, and you only accrue like 4 hours per paycheck. My boss also did not allow anyone to use their PTO if it was not requested 48+ hours from the day you want to use it. This means if you wake up sick or have a sick kid one morning and need to call in, they won’t allow you to use our PTO to cover the time missed nor will they allow you to make up said time. They just give you an occurrence no matter what the circumstance is if it has been less than 48 hours when requesting to use that PTO.Productivity standards are way too high for their outdated software they make employees use, too. They expect you to get a ton of work done but literally half of your day is spent waiting on things to load so it just doesn’t even out fairly for anyone.Decent pay, good insurance, work from homeAwful PTO policy, no vacation/sick pay, unreasonable productivity standardsNot enough training, non-responsive managementProgram glitches and system crashes make it very difficult to assist patients, who often become frustrated with us. The training is laughable. Its literally on the job training. Supervisors are nearly impossible to reach when you have a question that needs answered while a patient is on the phone. There is no encouragement. Only negative feedback. Patients are understandably upset and take it out on you.Holiday bonusShort breaks, numbers driven, not customer driven, software program issues, bad management and supervision, only negative feedback.Avoid this job at all costWorst job in the world, overboard rude callers, back to back non stop calls.. draining and exhausting. You will be burnt out by your first week if you even make it that long. Get Out!OverwhelmingZotec call volume is overwhelming, you only got 2 days of training and then you just cold transfer for everything else the calls are back to back you can hardly breathe the 2 day training class was the worst I seen ,there is no updates no tools on what to say to the patients they really need to reevaluate, there is no guidance and everyone seems to be to busy to support anyone its too much and their systems are horribleDecent pay, equipment providedEverything elseDo not work here if you still want to sleep at night!This company is not being ran with compassion, understanding, or anything else the CEO brands the business as. Due to this level of not only unreasonable micromanagement, the job expectations are not attainable with provider optimal client service and still meet business needs. Taking 100 plus calls a day will have you in an environment of being lackluster and not caring if the issue is resolved which causes the client to call back and become irate. Please save yourself the drama and lack of sleep and work for a company with dignity and trust for people whom desperately need it.Pay is ok.Micromanaging, horrible work ethic, managers do not care about your life.Zotec Partners is the bestI love Zotec Partners! This company truly cares about their employees and their families. I could not ask for better management or team. I have been with the company for 2 years and have lived everything about it.Management and leaders care for their employeesNoneDon’t work here.They do not care about you or your life they gave me a very late shift I begged for an earlier shift for months with no response the calls never stops coming 100 plus calls a days they allow the callers to say any on earth to you even death threats and you cannot disconnect the call. This place is ridiculous.Nothing.Everything.Great CompanyHad to leave for family reasons, otherwise good company to work for. Manager was wonderful always listened to concerns. Training was top notch and reinforced at office if needed.Wonderful manager and coworkers, good compensation, good trainingSmall office which is nice but not good if you are a private personMediocre JobIt's the same thing day in day out, nothing too exciting. You at least know what to expect, but feel like you're not going anywhere. Not much room for growth in a particular department, but you can apply for other open positions.3 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Remote workWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Managers babysitWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing timeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful1Great company and CEOPositive: The CEO is really a great person and very generous. Upper management is very good, always available and helpful. Decent bonus structure for some positions. HR very responsive to employees.Negative: Micromanagement and intense pressure on people working remotely with children during pandemic without support. Too many meetings and drawn out phone calls eating into productive time.Yearly holiday bonus, decent PTOmicromanagement, more meetings and phone calls than are necessary, women paid less than male counterparts, treated unfairly if you have children6Great companyA great place to work at. They really care about you. They provide plenty of training. Schedule is great and you don’t have to work weekends. Coworkers are nice and helpful.2Great coworkers, ok companyCoworkers were great. Management is a little disorganized. Benefits are on the lower side, not the best vacation time either. Need better cross functional collaboration.Awesome coworkers, flexible scheduleJob was boring at times and minimal directionPoor managementWork load was unrealistic. Overtime was expected. Pay was too low for the amount of work and stress you had to deal with. Lazy coworkers were overlooked while their work was divided up among workers already pulling a full load.Free lunches sometimesUnderstaffed, high stress jobNot a good company, poor communication on management and the entire companyI would never go back to that company. They do not communicate with the employees. If there is a problem it would take a long time to fix it. Any issues they do not investigate before they react to the issue.Work Monday through fridayEverything, go to a different companyGreat coworkersThe company culture is amazing but the company falls short on training opportunities in certain departments. Advancement and growth does not happen often enough.Management is terribleI worked here for 2 years. At first it was great and everyone was willing to help. Once through training though they leave you on your own and offer little to no help. There have been times when I would ask on something small from my manager (for example: fixing my time card because I missed a punch or accidentally added a punch) and they would not respond or help me fix my problem. When it came to IT errors (as a remote worker) they showed little to no sympathy when things were not in your control. The manager of my department set up weekly meetings so we can discuss where we stand each week. Every week they were cancelled except twice. The expectations from the manager were also very unclear. They would not tell you about production or what standards you were expected to meet.Compensation wasn't badManagementBest of 2020 and 2021 ... lolApparently, the founder is great but the management under him listens to Lou Holtz speak, but does not handle their employees with the true meaning of his speeches. Quantity over quality. We do not give good customer service. We will even get written up if our ""numbers"" reflect otherwise. Worst job I ever had.RemoteEverythingHorrible, retaliatory environmentDon't dare to bring issues of a non competent manager, they will retaliate against you, and get away with it.When I brought it up to higher management, they were shocked and actually concerned.Higher up managemt was nice, but lower management is horribleGreat location.Nepotism, throughout company. It really just depends on where you land inside the company. Management always has management backs, regardless of what they say to your face. To believe or accept anything less, would be futile. It's Chess vs Checkers when it comes to White ppl.Remote positionMy manager was not willing to provide additional training after the formal 2 week training. It's all about being on calls and trying To get off phone in 3 min or less. The 90 day probation period is a joke. They say your stats don't count until after 90 days however your stats count as soon as you start taking calls. I made several suggestions to have the training revamped as it is not sufficient for the job at hand. You simply need more than 2 weeks.Remote work from homeMgmt not supportive after 2 weeks of training, Its sink or swim, They are more concerned with getting patient off the phone in 3 min or less, instead of actually helping the patient, The training needs to be longer, so that you are better prepared to take the calls.Very positive culture with a ceo that has so much compassion for his employeesZotec is a wonderful company to work and the culture the company strives to create is so positive and family environment. Scott our ceo is such a caring boss and I’m sure that’s why zotec has been voted best place to work in Indiana multiple times.Company takes care of employeesShort lunchesUnorganized companyPoor management. No opportunity for advancement. Frequent layoffs. They value workers in other countries more than US worker which result in frequent layoffs of US workers.WfhManagementUnfair placeYou have to watch your every move. The Managment are unappreciative. If a patient ask for a supervisor and you transfer them because there accounts have never been handled you get a coaching. They don’t care about their employees or patients.to each it's own● Work-life balancethe job is great, their customers are nothing like the employer● Overallthis job is great but the ppl you have to deal with outside of this company makes my head throb. The job itself is great....i am not a therapist nor do I get their pay so....Good Company!!I like Zotec and their work. I definitely enjoyed working at Zotec! Only drawback was when one of my supervisor tried to micromanage few times. I am fine with the lay-off recently. Good people don’t prefer to leave good companies but prefer to leave bad management.Good work ethic!Bad management.Management team is exceptional. I worked remotely so no dress code.I loved working for Zotec and had hoped to retire from there; however the Coronavirus struck and cutbacks were made. I was one of 53 people laid off. It was very difficult as I truly loved my job.Anyone interested in working there when they begin hiring again should look forward to a great experience and give them 100%. You'll get it back plus. Great Company!Work from home.Laid off.Steer clearThis position has you doing nothing for AR. No follow up of any kind and you’re encouraged to write off everything. The management and directives are a joke. It’s a glorified data entry position and you’re asked to do things you’re not certified or knowledgeable enough about because other departments are lazy and under qualified for their positions.Terrible place to work.Don’t work here it’s awful! ! Don’t apply, just run! The training is the worst and you’ll lose any coding skills you have because all you do is move charges around. Very boring and management is awful!UnfairnessYou have to watch your back while working here. The true workers do not get acknowledged for working. The ones that don't want to work often run to HR with every ache and pain that they receive from others on the team.3 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Remote workWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Managers babysitWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing timeWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful1Patient centeredA good company that recognizes reaching your goals and the value of employees with yearly recognition bonuses. Yearly reviews and training via seminars.12Beware of Upper ManagementPoor training. Unrealistic productivity expectations. Benefits are not that great. At the end of the day, you're just a number and replaceable. They will pile work on existing employees rather than hire additional help.4Fast-paced environmentIt is a good place to work, My experience at Zotec Partners helped me grow as an individual and challenged me to reach my utmost potential in the position in which I thrived.medical billingThis position was particularly difficult for myself, as it is not for others. You can get calls that may be difficult to not be emotional with, due to the patient or family members situation. But was a face paced and keep you on your toes work place.I love this place!!I wish everyone could work for a place like Zotec. The culture is amazing and supportive and promotes a family atmosphere. If you want to move up there is always opportunity and the company is always growing. I have never worked for a company that cares so much for it's people and community. I wake up excited and ready to tackle new challenges every day.The worst and most ghetto under paying jobIt’s funny how they advertise as a professional work environment. Lies! No training; sick or swim. The culture is ridiculous! People literally go to work in Pajamas. I swear! Ghetto and unprofessional. Way underpaid for the problems you constantly hear about. Accounts going into collections with no fault of the patient. Constant verbal abuse from patients and pay you pennies. I’ve never in my life have seen something like this! Don’t apply!N/aI'm currently employed with Zotec through a staffing company so cannot say too much. My manager is a very understanding and considerate person and she actually cares for her employees.This place does not care about employeesYou will drown in their work expectations for a call center they balance bill patients and treat employees poorly telling you your almost achieving your goals but just not there then you get written upPfsMy review is the company is okay, just some managers. The work from home is great. Three days out of the week. The location wasn't so great not on the bus line.Great place to workThe people I worked with at Zotec became my second family I love and miss them all!! We had a very good time working together.We would always have pot lucks and bring food, if someone was down we would do everything we could to make them feel better. Birthday, and holidays were a blast here🖤Not a good fitZotec is all about making money. Company does not offer any incentives and very shady to the lower level employee. Zotec does not promote minorities to upper managementOk if you need workIt's okay if you just need a job no chance for advancement I turn over. The information given is inconsistent between management. Busy every daym every call is a angry patientPeopleHigh turnover no trainingManagement is something to be worked uponZotec is a wonderful company and they intice employee incentives but no further education on job training nor assistance in learning the job. Managers and Supervisors have not job descriptions and they won't give you the proper tools to learn.employee incentives and appreciationmanagementI love my Job!I currently work for ZotecPartners it is going on 3 years in October. I love my job! the people here are nice and everyone gets along to get the job done! I have had 3 promotions since being employed here and I do not plan on stopping there. If you are hardworking,determined, and skillful person come to Zotec! They will be hiring over 300 plus people at the end of next year!Productive but micro managedHigh expectations and will ding your calls for the smallest mistakes overall a pretty decent place to work. Training does need to be more elaborate and professional.small office, great enviroment, helpful coworkersmicro managingTerrible management.It’s a stressful work environment. You arrive at your shift and must be available on the phone and adhere to a schedule. Each shift is the same time daily, however, the break and lunch times may change on a day-to-day basis. You try and verify HIPAA info, obtain insurance to file a claim, or assist patient with further billing questions in less than 3 minutes. The training process is a joke. It’s more like you sink or swim. Don’t bother asking for any assistance after the 2 week training process is up. They advise they help build their employees, but there’s not many chances on getting far in the company for promotion unless you know the right person/people.Great CompanyI would go work there again. I don't want to type anything else but it's making me type 150 characters. Just work there if they pay what you want. It's a good place.Great placeI love the people, the customers are always rude. The training process is rough, they expect you to know everything within 2 weeks especially since they don't do any hands on training, they just give you a paper and tell you what to do. The trainers are no where to be found when you need them the most.Prejudice ManagersThe managers are no cultural and they treat you like you in day care not at work. They are depts. that micro manage in a non micro managed environment. Refunds is the devilProductive & FunIt is a very productive, but fun atmosphere. Answering phones & listening to patient's can some times be stressful. But the company sets up little games here & there to have a little competitive fun."

We work hard to ensure our team feels valued and respected. Thank you for being a part of NLM and helping make this company what it is today.Great Company - Tremendous Growth OpportunitiesNew Leader is a company that rewards employees who are highly involved, take pride in their work and want the best for themselves, their coworkers, the organization and our community. I've been provided the opportunity for growth and have seen many of my peers provided the same opportunities - professionally and personally. Employees are empowered to drive change and there's a strong team mentality - we do it together! NLM is a great company to be a part of.High Expectations, High RewardsThis company has been in my home town forever, they take care of their people with money, insurance, but if you want an easy job where everything is served to you, you won't last long.Pay, Benefits, Work Ethic, Business EthicsTraditional Office and Manufacturing, but that's what it is, so take it or leave it.Rewarding place to workGreat company to work for! As cheesy as this sounds, I've never worked at a place where I've actually enjoyed and been motivated to go to work. No day is ever the same and you're constantly learning. I've never had any issues with any co workers and it's true, everyone does treat you like family. I am really impressed that the CEO makes an effort to walk the production floor and greet all employees, not just the office.Profit Sharing- over 6k last year, Flex Hours- this is for all employees including production, Very Clean, Line Leads/Managers are very safety conscious, Feels like we get a free lunch every few weeks, Good PayCould use more bonus hours, More onboard training for line leads/managers, Small parking lotGreat companyI loved working at New Leader because my coworkers felt like family. Everyone was friendly and I learned how to do many different skills over my time there. I loved learning about all the different areas in the plant and how everything came together to make the units.- Great pay including bonuses, profit sharing, etc. - Company events including holiday parties, fall fests, and a Kernel's game - Lots of opportunity to learn and programs to further your education- None that I can think ofFriendly and safety oriented place to work .It is a family oriented business , the owners take the time to know their employees . the PTO is awsome and the benefits are some of the best around . I would recommend working here to anyone .Safety lunches, bonus hours every month for attendance, and very competitive pay . Great Benefits and PTO .None so far, I have been here 1 and a half years now .Accomplishing a finished amazing product.Loved working here. I was paid well, and, loved the team. Enjoyed working on projects that began at one end of plant, with raw materials, and, get to see our product on finishing floor ready for shipment.Quarterly bonuses, plant lunches for a job well done, or, a no accident goal.NoneProductive workplace with good traditionsNew Leader is a place for employees to grow in their skills and learn alot about how to improve themselves as well as the company. In my time here I learned so much about engineering and I still feel as though I barely scratched the surface. The culture is friendly and helpful and the work that I get to do feels like it makes an impact.free safety and quarterly lucnhes, helpful coworkers, laid back dress code, free tshirtsnoneBewareHigh turnover. A few good managers but are micromanaged where they’re unable to take ownership and be successful.Nepotism runs rampant.Lookout and beware all - just look at their employee wall and see how many long term employees there are. Very few!Clean/organized shopCultureGreat company with a great cultureI could quickly see why New Leader is one of the top workplaces in Iowa. They have a great culture and everyone shares in the success of the organization. They have many programs to keep employees engaged in their work and yet allow flexible schedules to help support family needs.Summer hours, profit sharing, safety bonuses, engaged workforceHigh StressA lot of turnover. More than any other place I ever worked. People were regularly fired and/or quit. Very little respect given to employees outside of a small circle. But even that circle was constantly changing due to turnover.Compensation was goodHigh stress environmentWe are family!!!I love it here!! I wish I would have started my carrier at NLM 15 years ago. I have never worked for a company before that treats you like your family. You aren't just a ""number"". They care about you no matter what role your in. If you need something, you say something and they will take care of you. They go above and beyond what a company needs to do for their employees. To name a few: safety lunches, quarterly bonus, many fun work events throughout the year. If that wasn't enough, they top it off with a huge Christmas party at the end of the year! We are appreciated! Under the roof at NLM you will find a team of All-stars and I'm thankful and proud to be apart of this squad!They took very great care of their employees! Good bonuses and extra activities.The company paid me well and was fair. The owner would come down once a week and say hi to us individually. They had a great pay structure. I miss working for this company!Membership Advantage checks and attendance bonus. Great People!Accumulating PTO was difficult but it has been improved since ive left.Poor ManagementThe pay is good and insurance. But management has unrealistic expectations, and goes off of what a select few of the ""lineleads"" say. Alot of the times that they give you on welding products are inaccurate,which if you go over on time expect to be talked to and have it count against you. Every mistake that you make no matter how big or small will be documented and brought up in your evaluations. There is minimal room for error especially with the new points system. They tend to be more reactive than proactive. You will also notice cameras EVERYWHERE it is supposed to be for ""security"" purposes. They tend to think the best way to manage people is to put fear into them and make you walk a very fine line. They micromanage everything.Great workplaceAwesome place to work, very nice and giving owner's. Great location. Competitive pay. Very friendly co-workers. Team oriented atmosphere. Great security system installed throughout entire facility.Free lunches..bonusesHard Workers SucceedI am a welder at Highway Equipment. I started directly out of high school, five years ago, as an entry level H3 welder on second shift. Within my first year and a half I learned every job in two separate weld lines. I was then promoted to an H5 welder and offered a position in yet another weld line on first shift. I worked very hard and within the following year was promoted to an H6 welder, our highest welder position. About 6 months after that I was promoted to Line Lead of two of the weld lines and have been doing that for the past two years. On top of that I now get to train all new hire welders. I have been given many incredible opportunities here at Highway Equipment Company. The company has no issue going above and beyond for employees who work hard and show potential. I am very grateful for all the company has provided me.Room for advancement, Exceptional compensation, Profit sharing, Great people, Incredible product, Plenty of opportunitiesGreat place to workHighway Equipment Company is a great place to work. Your coworkers feel like your family and the company cares about its employees. There's room to advance and management promotes cross-functional teaming.Profit sharing, safety bonuses, company events, free lunchesManagement out of touch with office personnelManagement needs to communicate with non management in office. Upper management only communicates with middle management. What middle says is taken as truth.paylack of communication between non management and managementgoodOnly was there as an intern. Being forced to write this review even tough I wasn't an actual employee. Learned alot had some fun. THats about it really.Great WorkersThe shop is filled with hard working individuals. Clock in and go to your job, if you do your best work you will be supported. They plan family events paid for by the company and offer great benefits.WelderWelder here the teamwork atmosphere at HECO is awesome most days, as well as the facilities are really nice compared to the other shops around this area. The expectations are high (which I liked) and those that worked hard and met those expectations, were rewarded every year with a raise; sometimes two raises a year! I never saw a single person laid off so business is ran very efficiently. The bad reviews I see on here look like former employees that were not a good fit for the culture and brought others around them down. the company provides the best tools and equipment on the market and values input from us on what works and does not work. Sometimes our thoughts are overwritten because of certain situations but at least they listen and consider our ideas.Pay, benefits, summer hrs, free events, locationThey care about FamilyYou’re their for the business purposes, but their is a good work/life balance.You’ll be a valued member of the team!You will have differences with other staff like you would at any job.

Everything rolls downhill, and the people at the bottom are the ones who are blamed for ""creating a bad culture"".A great deal of the managers always state ""we don't micromanage our people"", but then they do...all the time.People are not empowered, and everyone has an extreme fear of failure, so no innovation or risk/reward happens. No one is encouraged to try something new unless it is driven from the top.There are a number of bullies in the company. This then hurts employees who have a passion for what they do, the products that are built, and the customer, because they are always brought down by these bullies...some of whom are in executive roles...Departments work in silo's and compete against each other because there is no common goal. Communication is not great within the company either, again there is no common goal. It's all about making margins and cutting costs.There are some great teams and ""leaders"" who truly care about their people (HR, Marketing, Product Support), but they can't drive all the change that needs to happen. And since these leaders and teams don't fit the mold that the executive team has, then they are not looked at as examples for others.PayLack of culture and lack of empowerment205We are sorry to hear your time at Highway Equipment Company is not meeting your expectations. As we’ve stated in other responses, we strive to create an innovative culture in which our employees are given the tools they need to succeed and promote change through positive communication and action. While we disagree with your comments, we respect your right to voice your opinion. No company is perfect, but with 85% of our employees feeling engaged and 94% being proud to work at Highway Equipment Company, we feel we’ve succeeded in creating a respectful, rewarding, and fulfilling workplace environment.HighwayHighway is a place that you either like it or you don't. There are many good friendly people that are willing to help you out.My two centsOrganization is built on innovation, strong work, and tradition. If you want to work somewhere that values their employees, HECO (Highway Equipment Company) is the right place. The expectations are fair and reasonable, and if you meet or exceed them, those employees are rewarded.Pay, benefits, schedule, family environmentIf you do little to nothing, it will be recognized quickly.You won't go unnoticed!HECO, as it's known to those who work here, is unique for its size. A long-standing stable manufacturer that has made its home in Cedar Rapids and built a reputation as being the best in the industry.It is obviously not a place for everyone. For those that value recognition for hard work and ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY for everything they do, it can be a very rewarding place. For others, the attention and expectations that come from being a part of a company where everyone (including the owners) knows your name can be quite intimidating. For them, the hope that they can ""operate under the radar"" is quickly extinguished.If you take pride in what you do, do it well, and are comfortable with others noticing, then HECO is your kind of company. If that's not your style, then I'd look for a place where blending in is acceptable.While other local ag equipment manufacturers laid off up to 30% of their workforce during the recent downturn in the economy, the owners of HECO chose to do something generally unheard of...guarantee all employees 40-hour work weeks, even at the expense of profits! They get it. They recognize the value of each individual and their contribution to the company's success, they know our families, and they see those of us that work at HECO as people not simply employees.The company may not be perfect, but it continues to hold true to its core values of integrity, hard work, recognition, reward, and family. Does it fall short at times...sure, but couldn't disagree more with those that suggest its not a great place to work. Just ask the many peopleGreat people, high expectations, recognition, a family environment with big business opportunitiesNo tobacco products allowed on on the propertyNot a good fitExecutives are not in touch with employees & company lacks culture.High turnoverPeople on the shop floor work really hardOnly people in the office who are liked will move upFree lunches every quarter, profit sharingExecutive Team, snooty ownerswelderThe job is not bad but far from great!! It consists of doing the same or very similar things day after day. Management and communication is very poor.Good Employees, Lacking ManagementI learned new things on the laser, but more as you go than you do from training. Lacking training program with high expectations. Management issues and lack of communication. Management would tell other employees issues to tell other employees rather then tell the person themselves.Profit share, Owners, and coworkers.Management, Training, and CommunicationGreat CompanyI want to go back to work for them. Family environment. Your not just a number.A typical day at workI feel that this was a great company to work for. I felt at the time, it was not a diverse company, but they did make me feel comfortable.They care about FamilyYou’re their for the business purposes, but their is a good work/life balance.You’ll be a valued member of the team!You will have differences with other staff like you would at any job. But the owners truly care about the staff!11Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. We couldn’t agree more – our team is our top priority and our people will always come first. We work hard to ensure our team feels valued and respected. Thank you for being a part of NLM and helping make this company what it is today.Great Company - Tremendous Growth OpportunitiesNew Leader is a company that rewards employees who are highly involved, take pride in their work and want the best for themselves, their coworkers, the organization and our community. I've been provided the opportunity for growth and have seen many of my peers provided the same opportunities - professionally and personally. Employees are empowered to drive change and there's a strong team mentality - we do it together! NLM is a great company to be a part of.High Expectations, High RewardsThis company has been in my home town forever, they take care of their people with money, insurance, but if you want an easy job where everything is served to you, you won't last long.Pay, Benefits, Work Ethic, Business EthicsTraditional Office and Manufacturing, but that's what it is, so take it or leave it.Rewarding place to workGreat company to work for! As cheesy as this sounds, I've never worked at a place where I've actually enjoyed and been motivated to go to work. No day is ever the same and you're constantly learning. I've never had any issues with any co workers and it's true, everyone does treat you like family. I am really impressed that the CEO makes an effort to walk the production floor and greet all employees, not just the office.Profit Sharing- over 6k last year, Flex Hours- this is for all employees including production, Very Clean, Line Leads/Managers are very safety conscious, Feels like we get a free lunch every few weeks, Good PayCould use more bonus hours, More onboard training for line leads/managers, Small parking lotGreat companyI loved working at New Leader because my coworkers felt like family. Everyone was friendly and I learned how to do many different skills over my time there. I loved learning about all the different areas in the plant and how everything came together to make the units.- Great pay including bonuses, profit sharing, etc. - Company events including holiday parties, fall fests, and a Kernel's game - Lots of opportunity to learn and programs to further your education- None that I can think ofFriendly and safety oriented place to work .It is a family oriented business , the owners take the time to know their employees . the PTO is awsome and the benefits are some of the best around . I would recommend working here to anyone .Safety lunches, bonus hours every month for attendance, and very competitive pay . Great Benefits and PTO .None so far, I have been here 1 and a half years now .Accomplishing a finished amazing product.Loved working here. I was paid well, and, loved the team. Enjoyed working on projects that began at one end of plant, with raw materials, and, get to see our product on finishing floor ready for shipment.Quarterly bonuses, plant lunches for a job well done, or, a no accident goal.NoneProductive workplace with good traditionsNew Leader is a place for employees to grow in their skills and learn alot about how to improve themselves as well as the company. In my time here I learned so much about engineering and I still feel as though I barely scratched the surface. The culture is friendly and helpful and the work that I get to do feels like it makes an impact.free safety and quarterly lucnhes, helpful coworkers, laid back dress code, free tshirtsnoneBewareHigh turnover. A few good managers but are micromanaged where they’re unable to take ownership and be successful.Nepotism runs rampant.Lookout and beware all - just look at their employee wall and see how many long term employees there are. Very few!Clean/organized shopCultureGreat company with a great cultureI could quickly see why New Leader is one of the top workplaces in Iowa. They have a great culture and everyone shares in the success of the organization. They have many programs to keep employees engaged in their work and yet allow flexible schedules to help support family needs.Summer hours, profit sharing, safety bonuses, engaged workforceHigh StressA lot of turnover. More than any other place I ever worked. People were regularly fired and/or quit. Very little respect given to employees outside of a small circle. But even that circle was constantly changing due to turnover.Compensation was goodHigh stress environmentWe are family!!!I love it here!! I wish I would have started my carrier at NLM 15 years ago. I have never worked for a company before that treats you like your family. You aren't just a ""number"". They care about you no matter what role your in. If you need something, you say something and they will take care of you. They go above and beyond what a company needs to do for their employees. To name a few: safety lunches, quarterly bonus, many fun work events throughout the year. If that wasn't enough, they top it off with a huge Christmas party at the end of the year! We are appreciated! Under the roof at NLM you will find a team of All-stars and I'm thankful and proud to be apart of this squad!They took very great care of their employees! Good bonuses and extra activities.The company paid me well and was fair. The owner would come down once a week and say hi to us individually. They had a great pay structure. I miss working for this company!Membership Advantage checks and attendance bonus. Great People!Accumulating PTO was difficult but it has been improved since ive left.Poor ManagementThe pay is good and insurance. But management has unrealistic expectations, and goes off of what a select few of the ""lineleads"" say. Alot of the times that they give you on welding products are inaccurate,which if you go over on time expect to be talked to and have it count against you. Every mistake that you make no matter how big or small will be documented and brought up in your evaluations. There is minimal room for error especially with the new points system. They tend to be more reactive than proactive. You will also notice cameras EVERYWHERE it is supposed to be for ""security"" purposes. They tend to think the best way to manage people is to put fear into them and make you walk a very fine line. They micromanage everything.Great workplaceAwesome place to work, very nice and giving owner's. Great location. Competitive pay. Very friendly co-workers. Team oriented atmosphere. Great security system installed throughout entire facility.Free lunches..bonusesHard Workers SucceedI am a welder at Highway Equipment. I started directly out of high school, five years ago, as an entry level H3 welder on second shift. Within my first year and a half I learned every job in two separate weld lines. I was then promoted to an H5 welder and offered a position in yet another weld line on first shift. I worked very hard and within the following year was promoted to an H6 welder, our highest welder position. About 6 months after that I was promoted to Line Lead of two of the weld lines and have been doing that for the past two years. On top of that I now get to train all new hire welders. I have been given many incredible opportunities here at Highway Equipment Company. The company has no issue going above and beyond for employees who work hard and show potential. I am very grateful for all the company has provided me.Room for advancement, Exceptional compensation, Profit sharing, Great people, Incredible product, Plenty of opportunitiesGreat place to workHighway Equipment Company is a great place to work. Your coworkers feel like your family and the company cares about its employees. There's room to advance and management promotes cross-functional teaming.Profit sharing, safety bonuses, company events, free lunchesManagement out of touch with office personnelManagement needs to communicate with non management in office. Upper management only communicates with middle management. What middle says is taken as truth.paylack of communication between non management and managementgoodOnly was there as an intern. Being forced to write this review even tough I wasn't an actual employee. Learned alot had some fun. THats about it really.Great WorkersThe shop is filled with hard working individuals. Clock in and go to your job, if you do your best work you will be supported. They plan family events paid for by the company and offer great benefits.WelderWelder here the teamwork atmosphere at HECO is awesome most days, as well as the facilities are really nice compared to the other shops around this area. The expectations are high (which I liked) and those that worked hard and met those expectations, were rewarded every year with a raise; sometimes two raises a year! I never saw a single person laid off so business is ran very efficiently. The bad reviews I see on here look like former employees that were not a good fit for the culture and brought others around them down. the company provides the best tools and equipment on the market and values input from us on what works and does not work. Sometimes our thoughts are overwritten because of certain situations but at least they listen and consider our ideas.Pay, benefits, summer hrs, free events, location"
Personify,"Just okay.Often left on your own to manage difficult accounts and candidates. Often fearful of losing clients with no clear retention plan.

BRADY WORLDWIDE INC,"Manufacturing company firstI felt like a good amount of my time was spent working around firmware issues that management either doesn't acknowledge or doesn't think it's worth the effort to fix. Firmware quality is only so-so and adding features is an exercise in exposing limitations of the architecture.Great Company - Great Money - Great Culture!The work is hard but it's WORTH it. BEST place to work! Culture cannot be matched. They work with you to give you the skills you need. With commission, you will be paid WELL.It's a jobWouldn't recommend. Computer wasn't set up on my 1st day and whole experience went downhill from there. Lacked team oriented environment. Coworkers not very friendlygood culture to work fornothing really bad to say. I overall like the job. one of the best jobs I have had by far. Good group of people to work with. For the most part managers, supervisors or teamlead want to see you succeed.pay is decent and benefitsHard to move up because its alot of people thats been there for 10 yrs plusGreat People, Good ExperienceIt's really great experience to be able to see how a corporate office runs and works. The people are all amazing and super helpful. As an intern, there were tons of opportunities for me to learn and work on new things.A good amount of company outings, pay is great, people are niceIt's a corporate office so it's tough to get your ideas through sometimes, not the most interesting company to work forExpect nothingYour promised one thing and and turn around and around your expected to do a multitude of other tasks that weren't brought up management was never available and rotated between other departments.Great company and benefitsBrady offers you the chance to advance your career well offering work/life balance. The benefits are great and above average of what most companies offer. The benefits start on day one which was amazing! Pay is very fair and they actually pay you for your experience.Pay, benefits, work/life balance, growth opportunityCannot think of anyLaid backOverall good company. No micro managing. Very understanding when having personal emergency. Easy to request time off at the last minute……….Conservative manuf company trying to progressFocused on new product development and automation. Values technical roles mainly. Work life balance awesome but flexibility lacking. Lack of trust with people and leadership.Investment, cash, stabilityLack of trust. No flexibility for hourlyClean environment with low pay and bad managementCould be a decent place to work but it's bad management that's always changing. I had 4 different supervisors in 3 years. The pay is low. No fair structure of pay. New hires with less experience would get more money than me for the same position. The work is easy and it's a clean environment so it has potential to be a good place of employment if it was managed correctlyNeeds more effort in operations managmentPoor leadership and high turnover for operations leadership. Never had a consistent boss which lead to mixed management goals and general frustration by staff.Great benefitsThey have great benefits but people are treated unfair and management is below quality of what most would say is good .poor communication and toxic environment as well as underpaid .Lots of vacation timeUnfair practices .no opportunity to move up in companyThis is the worst decision you could ever make in your life!!They are very conniving and deceitful!! They literally hired us and kept ensuring us we had a JOB and that we WOULD go on permanent. But literally a few days before making the transition they Laid us off and basically was like oh well . Sickkkk!!!Get on the favorites listIf you aren't one of the favorites you will know immediately. I wish the management was more fair and treated everyone the same. Layoffs and loss of top key employees are going to ruin this organization. They will probably just sell it and buy another one.Good place to work, but not growOverall the culture at Brady and work life balance is great however the pay and compensation you come in at will stay the same, there is little opportunity to grow.Old school republican companyBrady is a decent company but the higher ups do not care about anyone below them. They make decisions only that make them happy. During Covid, they pretty much doctored the place up with Bandaids to make it look on the outside that they cared about the employees best interest but in reality they didn’t care. The managers and higher ups got to work from home while all of the lower people had to come in daily regardless of the pandemicManagement is horrible and lots of favoritism.Horrible management and need to be better by communicating with there employees. Lots of favoritism to get hiring up positions overall brady is a ok companyBenefitsTerritory ManagerThe Territory Manager role is highly valued at Brady. From the onboarding process [very hands-on], mentorship to support in the field. I wish the compensation was better.Independence.CompensationVery nice co-workersCame back from paternity leave boom, we have to let you go due to covid! No nothing just sent me right back out the door! Despite the fact i had a family to provide for !Work Harder Not Smarter- the company policyThe manager in charge of the Cust Ops department makes poor decisions without considers the work of their employees and how it will impact them. They continue to push new processes that don't work, a training system held up with straw, and gaslights employees until they quit out of frustration. What used to be a wonderful work environment has turned into needless stress about doing the job fast and not correctly. The current mindset of management burdens their employees to figure things out without providing resources, and continues to add more and more to peoples plates without a realistic way of achieving their goals. This is a very toxic work place.BenefitsEvertyhingGood workplace to work.Good place to work.A lot of standard and process needs to be improved.Product is not very interesting.Support groups from other site not very active.Good lunch menu, good people environment.Salary could improveManufacturing company firstI felt like a good amount of my time was spent working around firmware issues that management either doesn't acknowledge or doesn't think it's worth the effort to fix. Firmware quality is only so-so and adding features is an exercise in exposing limitations of the architecture.Old School Processes & Highly DisconnectedBest work-life balance imaginable with little to no roadblocks holding you back from taking ownership and leading a new development or project, but extremely challenging to innovate or challenge the status quo. Stuck in the 90sWork-life balance, friendly coworkersDisconnected, Lacks Innovation, No Growth, Hostile relationships and drama1Credit not fully given when deserved.It was ok at first, but the initial management moved on to better things and during covid everything fell apart. They let go about 80 employees who we’re highest paid but also most experienced. Decided to replace them with temps who were constantly revolving. Like most big corporations, always trying to save a buck from the lowest level hard working laborers to support the multi-million dollar CEO and the henchmen. Such a big company it’s hard to get recognized for the work you put in (unless you are part of the problem.) Management makes a lot of questionable decisionsNice cafeteria. A lot of veteran employees were decent hard working guys.Uninformed, clueless management that could care less about opinions from the workers regarding improvements.4Laid back good place to work except payThe place is good to work laid back but bad pay. Management is ok I guess you can't blame then it's corporate you blame other then that complain is only payGood breaks good peopleBad payIt was a good place to workI enjoyed my time there. Wish they had not closed the plant. It was a good place to work and I liked my co workers. They gave poor raises but I did learn alot.Nice place to workGood work to home balance. Some stressful days some smooth. A team environment, friendly staff. Workplace culture it okay. No micromanaging, just do your job and get it done.prefer 1 solid hr lunch instead of 30 mins lunch and 2 15 mins breaksNot GoodIf you're not with there politics you're wrong and you will get singled out if your a good worker they have their favorite so don't out do them you will get singled out they have there favorites you will get slow work or they will put you with a lazy man so they can fire youFree shirtsEthnic issuesFun laid back workplaceThis was a fun laid back workplace. Plant was mature. The people there were interested in seeing you succeed and there was fantastic orientation training.Laid back culturePoor healthcareVERY professional and well respected in the regulatory safety industryBrady is a global corporation with the US Division also being the headquarters. In the US, they are extremely successful, in EU Division they are not as developed, nor in the ASIA Division.The vast majority of management have changed since I worked there and the management altered the atmosphere for the worse. It became harsh and a bit of a ""boys club"".The interview process was intense, the training was excellent and the benefits substantial. I was in a position with 90% travel and was well taken care of by Brady. However, when my ""position was eliminated"" I was treated with negativity and abruptness.BenefitsMid-Management StyleGreat company who has supported the workers100 % during these tough times .This year has been challenging for many due to COVID pandemic . Brady has supported me by providing a stable job where I can work from home. The support and training has been the best .Positive work environment, dedicated management team .Unable to interact with co workersBe cautiousAt first, the job seems ok. It's hard work but if everyone works as a team, the day goes great. It just depends who your working along with. You could work with someone who takes long breaks or work with someone who really work as a team. It really depends.We haven't gotten a raise this year due to covid-19 but my company is hiring new employees with a $1000 sign on bonus which is really unfair. Also, pay is unfair.Vacation benefitsUnprofessionalThe absolute worst place to work I cannot stress this enough!!!!!!Absolute awful place to work!! Extremely poor management in this place!!! Managers are very buddy-buddy with a small group of employees and do not care about anyone else!!! Not to mention this place is littered with covid-19!!!! This place is sooo very toxic!!! Stay as far away from this place as humanly possible!!!! Save yourselves!!!None!This company as a whole!Lazy hiring.They hire way too many temp employees here and it makes the job harder than what it should be. They don't reward hard work and will start to side with the temp and make a long time knowledgeable employee feel discouraged.Not the hardest work.Hiring and management makes your job hard than it should be.Enjoyable co-workers, terrible benefits, and ""reward"" systemThe work was simple and sometimes tedious in the design department but the coworkers make day to day enjoyable. Able to wear headphones while working as long as you're not in manufacturing or a phone based position (customer service).The following story is obviously an outlier but you can see issues from it.Thee design department had a VERY rough onboarding. Moved the department from Manila Philippines to Buffalo, poor training, took 3 months to get 5 person department cubicles and not a meeting room. We were told we would be temp for 6 months and then moved to full employee, after a year of moving our seats and managers they finally started onboarding us. Only to be told all hiring would be frozen (by the CEO to keep the profits up that quarter) for another 3 months. During the freeze they decided to cancel the Christmas party for the whole building because sales didn't make enough money. Christmas was demoted to a luncheon that didn't even have enough food for everyone.Able to wear headphones, good vision and dentalBad healthcare, bad onboarding processhow management still have their jobs is beyond me.The management team is by far the worst possible.You have the top guy that constantly needed to be told how smart he is. Another one managed by intimidation.And the most worthless one never lifted a finger and knew almost nothing. I'd get a kick out of asking him a question knowing he wouldn't have an answernoneeverythingTerrible managementThis company is very far behind the times. It's a revolving door to fire reps then managers every other year it rotates. Too many senior level managers with no idea how to run a business or successful sales team. Company doesn't care about people or employees and the bottom line is getting smaller and smaller each year. I would run far from working here.Nice officeTerrible pay, office politics are rampant, favorites played. Income is terrible, hours are awful, no lead generation and terrible products and product managersIt a okay job.Not the best job out there and definitely not the cleanest place to work. Management need improvement and the work environment is awful. Alot of shady people there and they micro-manage to much. Definitely need to relax on the micro-managing. Just look for another job like hellermanntyton but if you really need a job then apply.Pay okay i guess and benitfits.Everything else.Overall good experienceGood work life balance, great colleagues and family like environment. Terribly outdated view on wfh policies. Policies during pandemic were outdated and didn't show care for employees even for office workers who had the ability to wfh.Not TerriblePay is pretty good compared to most companies, and the job isn't too hard, the supervisors are another thing though, everyone wants to be alpha dog and micro manage.Great, clean work environmentBrady is a great place to work at. One can balance work / life very easily. Management does a good job of communicating to employees to understand their needs.On Site Cafeteria - Work Life Balance - PayOccasionally can be stretched very thin on particular rolesAlways improvinggreat place to work, nice people, nice location, always growing company, great innovation and ideas from employees, management open and easy to approach.Manufacturing company firstI felt like a good amount of my time was spent working around firmware issues that management either doesn't acknowledge or doesn't think it's worth the effort to fix. Firmware quality is only so-so and adding features is an exercise in exposing limitations of the architecture.Working DailyWorking here is a mostly decent. The days are usually normal. Our Team Leaders are helpful and considerate. During the summer though, its very hot inside. And we also found out that this year, we get no raise or bonus.BenefitsConstant mandatory overtime2Compensation was reasonable, management can be nitpickyIt's a pretty self explanatory job, just very mundane. You will be busy from the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out. Order entry reps and customer service reps are pretty nice but the sales reps can be very rude and pretentious. Mostly because they're made to feel they are allowed to be that way by management. Management will give you rules, a sales rep will complain, management will change the rules. Not a bad place, just not great.Simple, clock in and clock out type of jobRude Sales Reps, VERY boringManagement fails at making employees responsibleWorking here was like always being under stress. I stayed because I had a great supervisor and he appreciated me. The job was almost constant pressure because maintenance was the only department held accountable for anything. The job itself was not bad but the culture toward maintenance was. Pay is good and is the only reason they were able to hire and keep maintenance. If you are ok with the stress for the pay then try working here and see for yourself.Good payManagementThey only care about the numbers not the employeesBrady was a good place to work for but not anymore. They track everything you do. What they do is much more extreme than micromanaging. Good leaders serve the people and help them grow. That does not happen at Brady.LocationManagementMuy buena compañíaEs una compañía que tiene buenas prestaciones y buen trato hacia el personalFun and focused Management and CrewA very welcoming crew, i felt at home the moment i walked on to the job site.Very Knowledgeable management and trainers, Will happily answer questions if you`re unsure of what task to do next.Lunch breaks were a fair 30 minutesGood pay great crewSmall business, not very flexible with hoursVery misleadingManagement has no direction with very little idea of what will make the team successful. Each shift works basically against each other instead of together as a team. No team atmosphere. Employees can feel disconnect between all management.Not a place for minority growth in any part of business. No job security. Ive had 6 new bosses in a year because they quit or are fired .Just a jobNo direction. Not a positive atmosphereMaterial Handler and forklift operatorIt was good job should have been paid more and better hours. The management we're unfair to me and some of the co-workers. A lot of favoritism there. I made some good friends there during my time there at Brady.Benefits is average as other companyLittle room for African Americans in growth, Managers, Team leaders, Supervisor they work African American and Asian more and doesn't promote these workers, you work at this company you feel like you are in Eastern state Penitentiary you feel like you lost your name and you assign a number. All they think is these interns with a piece of paper on the come asking you about your job, then telling you how you should do, the job you are doing all the year. One leader had a change in position twice in a year or two and this is a demotion.Lot of workTreatment is poorHorrible place to work!The okc warehouse is horrible! The manager is awful and cares nothing of the employees. The lead is a transfer that cares about nothing but himself and is a know it all. They will work you until you cant no more! NO FANS! You are expected to stay and help everyone finish their work even if you have done most of the work! They tell you 8am-5pm. I didnt get out of there before 7pm but maybe one time! DO NOT WORK HERE!None!Everything!Can listen to music while working, nice pace work not too fast not too slow.Amazing job opportunities, they are patient and willing to teach you how they expect the job to be done. You are able to listen to music and you get a fair amount of breaks. They offer free water, ice, and cups so you're always hydrated.WorkplaceThe company provided training, but the training program was lacking. They need to focus on the training that will be beneficial.work/life balance - not expected to take work homeCommunication was lacking at times, manager would share information with part of the team - a comprehensive email summary would have been helpful to share with the team.They had some potluck events for the holidays and occasional picnic or luncheon.Having a very understanding supervisor really helped in my professionalism and productivityBrady, on the coporate side, was very fast-paced and a wonderful place to work. I would recommend it to anyone. My supervisor was very supportive of making sure I got the training to help others. The culture was very much about helping others.Flexible hours within reason. Business casual dress.short lunches (which could also be a plus).Use to be good, not now.This is my second time working at Brady. I went back because the work was easy and they had increased the pay rate. May have been a mistake, because during this COVID-19 crisis, I've watched good people get fired for now reason. I watched a billion dollar company not give its employees hazard pay. And a list of other complaints.Great place to workI enjoyed the time I worked there. the environment was very up beat and the people are very knowledgeable about the business. very team based environment and everyone wants to help you do your best.Finished your work but stil not good enough???There is a system with pickers and packers where the company publicly highlights who's good and who's not and that dehumanizes people so much. You can bust your bottom working and they'd still talk to you weekly about your performance. Oh and also another thing is you have to work fast and yet have to count over 100 items at times and if you were over just by 1 or under by 1 that was also publicly highlighted too.Dont believe what they tell about advansmemts and payOver all management is very poor pay raise are unfair and there is alot of prejudice within the company and some of the workers are for themselves the new employe training is very poor my over all experience rates about a 3 one thing i can say its a clean environment to work inIt was okayI like it because it was easy and all I had to do most of the time was operator a forklift. However, the pay was not that great and i didn’t like how dusty the environment was.Brady corporationGreat place to work. Schedule was nice. Work was work. The people I work with was nice. Also the mangers. Hardest part of the job was making custom parts. But after I learn it came easy.Terrible place to work!!Had an alcoholic for a manager that didn't care about anything. You try to tell him about issues and he didn't want to hear it. Would tell you he's busy and walk off!! It was also a very hostile environment!!Pay was decentManagement was terrible!!!"
Skyward,"Great people low payGreat people and great training but the pay was low for the amount of work that was required. Call center type of environment with numbers you are expected to hit.

What initially attracted me about the job was the ability to help school districts and grow my own career. Unfortunately, I had my hands tied at every corner and was given no discretion to help the schools.

While some of the benefits could be better (including pay in some departments/positions), Skyward is 100% the best working environment I have ever been in and strongly recommend them as employer to anyone.Great new building, flexibility, the people401k match could be better, pay could be better for my positionPoor working enviromentEmployees like to spread rumors, and try to get others in trouble to make themselves look better. Co-Workers like to talk about others in hopes that it will cause that employee to quit.Training is very long, and most of the time, your just sitting there with nothing to do.If you like to have people trying to back stab you, and sitting on your butt watching the time barely move, then you will like it here.Management likes to talk to other employees, and spread rumors as well. There is no common sense within this organization. If you need management help, be prepared to get confused. Managers do not know anything about the software, and are always complaining that employees do not work fast enough or know the correct information.Basically, working for Skyward is a joke. More people quit due to the working environment of being in High School. Rumors being spread that are untrue along with Management being clueless.PayCompany environment, Clueless Management, Co-workers spreading false rumors just to make themselves look better.Fun place to workFun place to work. Enjoyed learning new processes to further my business background. Management was great and always willing to help and assist with any questions.Pretty decentReally the only complaint is that while Management is nice, they are really bad at micro-managing. It does get annoying after awhile having them watch your every move.Advancement is just okay. It is possible to advance up the ranks, but unlikely. Promotions do happen, but they're more so based on how long you've been working there, which is understandable. Yearly 3% raise too. 2 bonus's every year as well.Good Pay, Terrible Management, Don't BotherI worked at Skyward for 3 years in two different departments. The people are generally very nice and the pay is good. However, the training is terrible and the managers are just employees that get paid more. Once you go through the training you are left on an island to figure out things for yourself and encouraged not to bother managers. Morale for many is low and complaints during breaks is common. Many stay because the pay is good and its hard to find good pay in this area. Most start out with enthusiasm and high hopes for advancements, but that dream is shattered when you realize how awful it really is. Skyward is always hiring and there is a good reason....because people are always leaving.Decent pay and hoursPoor training, morale, and managementCollaborative atmosphere, rewarding work, fantastic employeesSkyward is a unique, home grown company that takes pride in its product, mission, and employees. Skyward really puts it's employees first by promoting collaboration, offering bonus pay and competitive salaries, paid time off, and flexible work schedules. Working for Skyward is also rewarding. We create, promote, and sell software for students and school administration as well as for government municipalities. Knowing that our jobs directly help school districts and cities function more efficiently is very rewarding. Across the company, employees are incredibly kind and helpful. Skyward is a very upbeat and positive place to work. All of these factors truly make coming to work each morning worthwhile.Company contributes to 401k, has paid company parties, wellness programs (including free gym memberships), travel opportunities, casual dress, sponsors employee sports teams, flexible schedules, competitive salarySkyward Customer SupportOverall the position is OK. Being in Customer Support can be very boring when its not peak times and be prepared to travel A LOT. The training is very poor which is one of their greatest downfalls.Benefits, Room for AdvancementWork CultureExcellent Job for the Stevens Point, WI areaA typical day at work would be 9-10 hours of conference calls throughout the day fixing software problems or training. If out of the office, then working new customers and training them the product. Management is always pushing me to develop to the maximum level. Co-workers are for the most part very nice to work with and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain a very efficient service call quota daily. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the travel.international travel, travel rewardsnot enough travel"

Ameren,"Great work life balance. Very safety oriented environment.Working remotely since the pandemic started has been wonderful. Very family first company. I would recommend this to interns as well as veterans in the field.Not What It SeemsManagement will go from the truth in the interview to get you aligned with the company. Most of the individuals do not understand or are poorly trained at their positions. Pay is good however.Pays wellLots of stress and drama. When Covid hit upper management hid in their basements dictating policies and left supervisors out on their own with little or no support.Good pay and benefitToo many hours for the salary paidGreat pay and benefits. Horrible work/life balance!I can only speak for the customer service department...RUN AWAY and do it quickly!!! This is the sweatshop of Ameren where promises are constantly broken, management knows no more than the employees, and customers talk to you like you're trash. Union positions with amazing pay/benefits. However, the union protects Ameren, not the employees...even after they admit there are many issues with the customer service department.If you enjoy being highly stressed, lied to, and talked down on...this is the portion of Ameren that is right for you!Pay and benefitsManagement, zero work/life balance, union that is for the companyBad cultureVery negative culture. Any company that has a separation policy is not a good place to work. Employees should want to stay there not be threatened on leavingVery unorganized which leads to very little workVery unorganizedPsychology ExhaustingPawnee- Management encourages employees to actively compete to get others fired for their own personal vendettas. Management will set you up to fail or will continually harass you until you’re forced to resign. Endless criticism towards the easiest of tasks. Scare and humiliation tactics are carried out on soft targets to intimidate the rest of “the team”. Subjected to absolutely horrific exclusionary tactics. Retaliation is encouraged after submitting a complaint against management. The amount of money offered to give up your absolute need for family time/work life balance isn’t worth any of the hassle. Don’t waste your life for this company.Great benefits, but more toxic than Ameren would ever admitPROS: The benefits are outstanding. Health, dental, vision, 401k, pension, yearly bonus, disability, generous vacation & more than ample sick leave, life ins, flex work options. Pay is ok, depending on how hard you work. Good employees are run into the ground, which makes the pay minimal. Lazy people are never fired and just get transferred all around the company, so they get paid pretty well for not doing anything. It takes years to get fired so you have plenty of time to find a job before you will ever get let go.CONS: if you’re a good employee, be ready to do all the work of every lazy employee in your department and be run into the ground to the point where you’re making $1 an hour. Your life will be miserable while the laziest person runs around doing nothing, disappears for hours or even days on end, and you do all their work. Meanwhile, directors say nothing and do nothing. It’s incredibly toxic and most “leaders” have no idea how to lead. They don’t know how to run meetings and half of them are awkward silence until someone else finally speaks up. The company has also taken a turn over the past few years to be “all inclusive” and diverse, which has pushed it the other way and they are now not hiring the most qualified people for the job but just ensuring that they hire the most diverse person. These comments are for company wide, but my department is no different either. It’s all changed over the past couple years and i would not recommend if it was a family or close friend asking.2 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?The pay was awesome! I met a few people that were pleasant and good to work with.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The culture. Very racist and intense.Retirement benefits not guaranteed, pay is goodIt’s best to work here until you’re 67+. Retiree health insurance and pension are not guaranteed and are changing each contract. No cost of living raises and raised premiums from $0 to $258/month. Work here until you’re Med Elgible, 67 for most.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Interaction with my managers, supervisors, and co-workersWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Outages and having to reassure our customers that service will be restored as soon as possible.Can be a stressful place to workThis position can be a very stressful position. The work life balance was not there for me. I did love the health benefits and retirement benefits and the pay. Advancement came by seniority. Overall this was not a good fit for me.It’s okNeeds some changes but that’s anywhere. Management is not the best. The pay could be better for the amount of work being done while others get paid more and do less extensive.Great place to work with great ethicsThis is by far the best company I've ever worked for. They I always get back to the community and treats employees very well. One of a very few jobs I've seen outside of union jobs that offer a pension and 401(k).i love my jobi love my job cant complain. it pay the bills. food is free. rather not work for their ops. They try to run up on me on the site. so, told them I will never say never I will fight I will fight 'til foreverTo make it right Whenever you knock me downI will not stay on the groundfree food, free electric and they pay my billsthey pay billsA great career.Many years of working for the company really pays off for family and lifestyle. Benefits are good and the company helps the community. They have assisted The United Way , blood drives and other health organization s.Plenty of training.Some stressful work environments in emergencies but its geared toward your safety.Stable career with decent pay.Stable career with decent pay. Offers hybrid work schedule for certain positions. Overtime opportunities with storm assistance. Many different offices spread throughout state.Overtime opportunities. Hybrid work schedule. Safety driven.Training structure could use some attention. Insurance is expensive.Overall good place to workI enjoyed my time there. Ameren is an inclusive company. Always more to learn and room for advancements. Would recommend Ameren to others. Great benefits and good pay.Opportunities aboundGood leadership, lots of capital work. Plenty to learn. Compensation is kept low for existing employees while they fairly compensate external hires. Benefits are diminishing by the year.DisappointingWay too long of training 3 months?! but not long enough on the job training. Only one out of the three instructors actually works.. the shooting qualifications are ridiculous. I have always wanted to work here but as of right now, it’s a major let down. Ameren gives ZERO sick or vacation days for the first year. I guess they assume you won’t get sick or need a day off for the first year cause they’re just that awesome to work for.. not.. oh! They also give ZERO maternity or paternity leave.Pay is decentMostly everythingDecent place to workBiggest pro is the flexible work policy and potential to have a 4-10s or 9x80 schedule, but you have to find managers that allow it. Employee satisfaction and workload seems to vary widely based on the branch of the org that they report up through.great co workersnothing to say when it was Illinois Power it was a great place to work after the new companies took over it was a pain. Laying off people the clerical workers has to do the job of three people very stressfulGreat work life balance. Very safety oriented environment.Working remotely since the pandemic started has been wonderful. Very family first company. I would recommend this to interns as well as veterans in the field.Amazing work cultureMy team is so supportive and inclusive. We work together and everyone is so reliable. The management in my department is progressive and good. I really like my team and the flexibility of working remotely.Job securityA place you can work for years and grow. Does have the options to move up and achieve more. Does have strict schedules during some periods of the year.Good pay and benefitsGood pay and benefits. Like any company, a lot depends on who you work for and their upper management. I worked for both good and bad managers. Although I am now retired, I believe things have gotten better, especially for minorities.Productive place to workJob is a lot mentally but overall the company is great. Management is supportive and pay is good. Good benefits also. I can see a future with this companyDo Not Take A Job In Ameren ITDon't go to work in the Ameren Digital PMO.So much manual work. Lots of checklists to follow and paperwork to do. Nothing is automated. The micromanagement of weekly progress reports, weekly financial reports, and weekly reviews and scrubs of information is crazy. It's to the point that a project manager's job is no longer about managing the project but about keeping up with the paperwork. Instead of automating any of it they chose to hire more managers. Most of them are from the outside of Ameren and all with little or no IT project management experience. They are there to drive and micromanage the teams, so you spend your days checking boxes, filling out forms, asking a project team how many hours they've spent on a project in a given week and how many hours they estimate they'll work on it for the next week so you can report on it. Project funding requires the review and approval of too many people and too many meetings, so it takes months.Agile as it's known in the industry is not here. The Agile implementation is a hacked up mess at Ameren and the company has been very slow to adopt Agile. They are decades behind other companies.It's all soul draining. The best people have already left or are looking, that's why you see so many job openings. It's not growth, it's turnover.Don't take a job here. There are better companies with more competent management in place.PaycheckMicromanagement; Manual processes with too much overheadGreat place to have a long term career.Ameren is great, you are not expected to know anything that you have not been trained to do. But once you're trained, you are expected to perform that task without error, always. Long work hours at times, but it's not just one person, it's the entire site (Callaway). ERO duties can be stressful. Every worker is expected to maintain near flawless work activities. Everybody works 30 years here and retires. If you can't handle being coached on your flaws/mistakes, don't work here. Almost all work performed is performed independently, not much help unless you specifically seek it out.Pay, benefits, peopleLong hours, stressfulSpiraling DownwardWhat was once an awesome place to work has become a workplace filled with fear, leading to a mass exodus. Fantastic employees are bolting for the union side or leaving all together for different utilities. Upper management can't stand-up to the union, so to make stakeholders happy, they save money by reducing pay and benefits. They have changed the paybands leading to smaller bonuses which have been reduced by 50% over the past 4 years. Pension is next. Despite so many people leaving, they are not filling all the positions leading to added workload for those of us stuck here...waiting for our shot to bolt. Everyone in my group is walking on eggshells, fearful of what may happen next. Ameren was once a pretty good excuse to stare at corn and soy beans all day, but the drop in compensation along with Illinois taxes doesn't make putting up with this place worth it.Met some life-long friendsDrop in compensation and poor upper managementSolid job security but pay is low once experienced.Great job security with superficial title advancement program. You will receive title growth along with increased responsibilities. Compensation does not follow suit for engineering positions. Engineers are brought in from college at a fair salary, but the longer you stay the less competitive the pay versus leaving. Many engineers who stayed, have transferred to union craft positions for better pay.You will need an exit plan before starting as an engineer at Ameren.Job securityCompensation, health insurance costsGreat Benefits, Poor work life balanceWhile the compensation and benefits are top notch, the work life balance is non-existent. You are a seat warmer and not a person, just get the work done regardless of what it takes. Extensive travel is expected of some and is not an option regardless of family life. If you're willing to live to work it's a great place.Compensation and BenefitsPoor Work Life BalanceSupportive environment that promotes learningI've had a great time working at Ameren. As a co-op I came into the company with little knowledge and experience but that hasnt been an issue. The poeple I work with want to get me involved and show me what they are working on. Have been working with really smart people who know what they are doing. Sometimes the work can be repetitive but at other times you get to work on really interesting projects and learn a lot.Pay, work flexibilty, cultureLots of downtime, takes a while to really get involvedSolid company with good benefitsManagers were very helpful in getting me where I needed to be. other employees were always willing to help if I had any questions or wanted to network. overall a pleasant experiencePay is great, benefits are lacking recently. Promotions don't happen often unless you are apart of the click.I good company to work for but if you're looking to advance, don't get your hopes up. Although you can transfer to other departments rather easily if you are qualified.Job stabilityYou're easily replaceable in the eyes of upper management and they let you know it often verballyWorked here for decades - great place for a careerExcellent salary and benefits, mostly a great place to work, but like anywhere, there are good and not so good folks. I have been lucky to have great supervisors and managers my entire career. There are still some ‘old style’ in-your-face management around, but that is slowing being replaced with more supportive style supervisors. Great sense of satisfaction providing critical service to our community.Work-life balance, salary and benefits, job satisfactionSometimes necessary change is slow to happen.Good pay horrible experienceYou are paid well in return you will dedicate your life to the company or they will make your life miserable! I saw it a lot in twenty years!They are knee jerk reactionary company.Always trying to bow to every liberal notion thrown at them.Lower management is treated like dogs and paid like it.Union is paid well because of the contract but treated like dirt unless you are a minority of some sort!Good payHorrible “woke” companyCareer AdvancementDifficult to advance in this company to the Executive Level . The company needs more diverse leaders and opportunities for diverse employees to be in the executive roles.Great place to work and grow.Great place to work. It is a place full of options. People are supportive and the work gets broader when there are customers to serve during times of inclimate weather. The teams solidify and strive for greatness.Cares about the people within and the community at large.Storm work is necessary but can be challenging. Many sacrifices by employees during such times.it was good pay dirty very hot first line supervisors hard to work for very strict blamingThey paid good for safety record was decent the bosses was not that good benefits was above average it was not friendly towards there employee and worked a lot of swingshift and long hoursPayWeekly swing shift and a lot of discipline actions to employees without caueGood pay and benefitsMost management take care of employeesGreat benefitsGreat programs for upward mobilityGreat alt leadersMost departments are flexibleGood payBecoming more diverseSimple work, not challenging, not motivatedI worked in the design center in Peoria was for 5 years. We were all overpaid for the work. EVERYONE is overpaid at Ameren. Sadly I got put on Performance Improvement Plan and it screwed me over big time. I didn’t receive a bonus for 2 years because of it. Bonuses were in excess of 10% of the salary. The same work is also completed in the union design center and they are paid 15% or more than the design center in Peoria and we outproduced them. I also never had a single conversation with my supervisor’s supervisor for over 4 years. The first time he ever spoke to me was in my meeting about the PIP and he was always in the office for meeting, etc.Good benefits, decent coworkersNo bonus if on a PIP plan.Stable but cheapYou will never lose your job. Company moves extremely slow. Performances never get rewarded. Every employee gets treated the same and it feels like HR is not on your side.Great work life balance. Very safety oriented environment.Working remotely since the pandemic started has been wonderful. Very family first company. I would recommend this to interns as well as veterans in the field.Productive and fun workplaceWorkplace culture is great, everyone in the team is very helpful. Learned a lot about the real-world engineering work. Enjoyed the entire period of my internship. :)If you apply yourself and you're willing to do it go for it you won't regret it.Besides owning my own company. Has been by far the best job I've ever had. Great pay good people verse here there's a reason it's been voted the happiest the nicest place to work.You make a lot of moneyYou can end up working long hours1Horrible Upper LeadershipThis is company itself is amazing, HOWEVER, The leadership (manager and a couple select supervisors) within the Decatur call center is horrible, bias, and even to some extent racist. They do very well with keeping up with major diversity inclusion topics to appease the most higher up's but within the center it's certainly not a standard they live by. They make sure everyone is notified when the higher up's in coming for a visit and everyone is lectured to make sure they look and behave their best those days. To my understanding, many reports have been filed to HR from many, many people and nothing is ever really done. There are a couple supervisors even, that aren't happy because they feel constantly targeted or harassed. It's extremely micro-managed. I feel and have witnessed that retaliation is a very real thing here, but they have either figured out how to get a way with it, or have someone higher up in their corner saving them somehow. Or both. It's really sad because this really is an amazing company to work for otherwise. The CEO and President seem great, and are super personable. The company does pay quite nicely with great benefits.The last six years the place has gone down with management employee turn overThe last six years the place has gone down hill with management employee turn over and failing to promote from within. All high paying leadership roles are being filled with people from outside of the company and not internally like they had promised 4 years ago. Rarely do the ever get rid of managers/supervisor who are horrible in his/her leadership roles. Until the last 24 months, getting training and certification opportunities had been difficult. I've been here 14 years and I've been passed over for promotion and different job opportunities, even though the company says they like to promote from within, they rarely do. This went from a place I wanted to spend 20+ years at and retire from, to now a place I'm actively looking to get away from cause I see they don't value myself and a lot of other hard working folks like they claim they do.Decent work placeWork was rewarding knowing that you were able to assist customer to prevent their electric utility services from being disconnected due to non-payment.Enjoyable place with plenty of people to help when needed.Ameren is family oriented and cares about it's employees safety and health. If the weather is going to be bad in the winter they advise you to stay at home and work if possible. When ill Ameren wants you to stay home and get better. There are always people around you if you need help with an issue and the I.T. department is rather quick when you are having difficulties at your computer.Why is Ameren Digital hiring so many mafia wannabes?Several new hires in the last year coming from a local company that tanked and was bought out. They are bringing their bullying, threatening, unstable management ways with them.These people have brought bullying, yelling, table pounding, tearing people down style with them and it's awful. It's a dark and sinister time. I fear they will destroy Ameren the same way they destroyed their former company.The amount of money and time it takes to support everything they want and need is outrageous, and there's little to no value produced from it all. It's all politics, bureaucracy, paperwork, and pettiness from this crowd.Why is Ameren Digital bringing on people that have already destroyed one company with their over bloated, dishonest ways of working and doing business? We are going to tank and be bought out by someone else if we're not careful. There's one group that has up staffed 4 times of what they were before and management has absolutely nothing to show for it other than a lot of extra headcount. No cost savings, no risk protection. Nothing. It's a total laughingstock.Best place to work everI have been working at the contractor for more than a yearProslearning opportunities and a wide variety of areas to specialize in. Additionally, it's wonderful to work culture. The community and care for their employees surpass that of any other place I have been.ConsAt a huge company, it is easy to get lost. To be successful you must know what you want to do and be willing to speak up to get there.Emotionally abusive leadership being added in DigitalOnce a great department to be in.Ample vacation time and great benefits.The qualities of the leadership that's been added to the Digital team in the past 2 years has been that of gaslighting, narcissism, and emotionally and verbally abusive behaviors and actions.There is a constant stream of what-to-say-and-how-to-say-it coming from leadership these days. There's also advice and guidance on haircut and color, clothing selection, and much more. None of this is documented in the employee manual.You can count on a manager taking you and several others aside after meetings to give you 'coaching' and 'feedback'. This typically entails a conversation along the lines of ""I wouldn't have said it this way. I'd have said it another way instead."" Was anyone offended? No. Were any laws or rules broken? No. It just didn't pattern what the manager would have done so therefore it was 'wrong'. It's gotten crazy. Most of us are afraid to even send out an email anymore for fear of the tearing down meeting that comes afterwards. Life is far too short to deal with this daily emotional wrangling and nitpicking. There was a time when our managers were too busy working on important things to behave in this way.I use to love coming to work every day. Nowadays I dread it. You never know when you're going to be spoken down to, trivialized, or called onto the carpet for nothing. Due dates change and move forward on a whim. Conversations that no one but leadership can recall having happened. A regular stream of put downs and insensitive comments. It's become a very negative workGood corporate cultureAmeren is very customer-focused. They are willing to get together impacted areas to work through issues and develop approaches that make sense in the long term, even if it makes things more challenging in the short term.No Job SecurityI feel as though it would be great company to work for if they did not just look for things to fire their employees for. Instead of appreciating the good in their employees they only focus on the negative.overtime, free foodno job securityStuck in the 1980sLast option I would consider. Old school, too many older employees that need to retire and move on. Lots of excess overstaffing, waste, hugely bureaucratic, inefficient, tolerate bullying and toxic, retaliatory behaviors by managers. Directors have no spines or think they are little kings and queens of their universe. Need Carl Icahn to come in and gut it and start over.Great place to work!Ability to utilize your best skills and share insights among team members who are looking to find a better ways of performing their tasks. Lean continuous improvement a high priority.Driving around painting Gas Meters was an easy job for a college student.Being outside all summer was not the best idea for someone who usually spends their days indoors, but being to meet new people every day was entertaining.Tell it like it isWhen i started there i used to love going to work. The longer i worked there it got very frustrating.There is reverse discrimination. Family favoritism. Whites are passed over for reassignment if one of the black family members want it.I retired after 17 yrs because of all of the issues there.Yearly raisesCustomer service is the worst department within the company. We all have different responsibilities but they treat each department as if we all take phone callsLow Turnover RatesIL side of Ameren could use more diversity. Although they display that is what they are trying to achieve, the population of the IL employees does not represent that policy.Free Luncheshigh school environmentProductive and opportunity for advancementWork place culture was constantly evaluated and necessary culture change activity initiated to sustain the desired work culture! This was a favorable and effective strategy!Exceptional training in all fields!Management employees downsizing separation, 25 years & age 55+, during the ""Great Recession"" 09/2009 - 12/2010.Poor leadershipMy management doesn’t want teamwork just military style management and micromanagement. My review was totally a bad surprise. No coaching or leadership. It sucked.N/aIt would be helpful if older coworkers are more welcoming to internship student but they are rather hostile. I Had more than two supervisors assinged to me and they have me work on unrelated project as compared to the project that I was hired for. One of the supervisors mentioned they intended I fail in my internship experience.Good for them."

There are a lot of engineers who work for Shure, which creates a nice environment and adds to the culture.BreaksVery good people but management is unfairThe products on that company is super and the finance is very stable. The people there are probably the best to work with. The only issue I can see with that company is the upper management. The unfairness is the common theme through out the company. If you are the hand pick one, you can do no wrong and will be set for life there. If you are not, there is no advance opportunity for you there.Good stable jobunfairnesshappy work with shureshure company is very good to work with and fun and co work is very nice to work with.shure alway tell employee alway costomer come first and happy and funToxic working environmentWhen left my previous job to join Shure, to be convinced I was promised many things that in short term I could see that were just false promises, between them the respect and life quality that didn't exist. Instead of this, there were a lot of bad things, that I don't want even recall to say here - this is just the tip of the iceberg, and such things didn't happen only to me.The saddest thing is HR knowing about this kind of behaviour and just closing their eyes and letting things happen, only because sales targets are being achieved.The company has great products and great professionals, but unfortunately the company needs to re-evaluate its concepts and pay more attention to the human resources, avoiding them to suffer harsh behaviour from certain managers.Disrespect, working WAY more than was set, public humilliations, etcA nice environment to workIt is a nice environment to work.

The corporate culture of continuous improvement was well supported and nurtured.Typical day at work: review MRP messages immediately; spend 1/2 of my AM on the production floor; prepare for production meetings PM; review capacity reports for work centers I planned and scheduled; finish day on the production floor.What I learned: ownership; proactive mentality; continuous improvement mindset; corporate core values that one can use in his personal life.Management: supportive of work force; family friendly company.Hardest part of job: New Product Team leaders wanting to compromise corporate and plant policies.Most enjoyable part of job: Enjoying a strong relationship with production staff.Fairly predicatable work day expectations; supportive management.Outsourcing direct labor jobs and jobs that support direct labor to Mexico and China, refusing to recognize the marketing value of MADE IN AMERICA!was a good place to work for awhileI worked at the wheeling facility for 8 months as a temp. I enjoyed working the first shift with overtime. The company phased out the production area and turned it into a finished goods area.

Instead of hiring the temps permanently they rehired their production staff and let go the temps who were already trained in the finished goods area.management didnt care about the temps a lotGood place to workShure is a good place to work that makes industry leading products.

It was a very clean environment to work in. My typical day was filled with Customs related Job Tasks. I found Shure Management to be spirited, friendly & open-minded to new ideas. My co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of the Job was any Projects that needed to be completed in a concise & short time frame, due to Staffing Shortages.

The mid level managers are typically left with the weight of the company on their shoulder while The branch managers disappear to God knows where for God knows how long while they roll your calls VM and return to criticize how you handled the situations that came up while they were gallivanting around. The branch managers report to regional managers who do not communicate directly to mid level managers. This presents a huge gap for the branch managers to do whatever they please while leaning on mid level managers the be the ""fall guy."" Technicians are often overworked and underpaid.

EquipmentShare,"Best Place I have ever worked!This is hands down the best career move that I ever made. The sky is the limit. I feel appreciated, like I am making a difference. Awesome company, awesome people.salary, culture, wellness incentives of amazon gift card or PTO, $25 monthly giftly award every monthnone1Total lack of direction.Middle management at the mercy of horrible upper management. No problem is dealt with just throw more money at it and act surprised when it isn't fixed.Throw money at problemsLooks good so farJust started here at equipment share. Excited to see what the future holds for this company. So far management has been great. Seems to be a very fast growing companyGreat companyThe company has many incentive programs. Monthly dinner gift cards, semi amusing gift cards for work clothes, boot reimburse. Just an all around great company to be employed by.Unless you are into politics and dont care that you could be fired at anytime for any reaosn.Management has no integrity or values or morals morals. You can be fired for no reason at any time so there's absolutely no job security. If you were not a yes man type person that gives their heads down you'll not do good at this job and you will be fired at some point just because. No matter how hard you work you will not be rewarded only be rewarded if you want to step on toes.All the benefits you could want with monthly gift card to take your family to dinner, the people outside of management are amazing even the owners and I wish they knew what was going on!Bad Management, no job securityslave driversThey expect you to bend safety rules and cut corners of quality just to meet their numbers.Any complaints will be ignored or mocked. The hardest working employees get criticized for not giving up their life to work.snacks that run out because the managers eat them firstwhere mental health goes to dieWhen something appears to be ""too good to be true"" It is!In theory this company has a great idea "" people first"" monthly gift cards sent to each employee for ""family dinner night"" wellness program to earn time off or gift card, PTO and remote work available... but the dark side: Vendors aren't being paid, ES is on credit hold with most, if NOT all of them! High turnover rate, there is a reason why this company is always hiring! No job security, someone can be fired for no valid reason! Our branch witnessed it first hand! People walk around wondering out loud ""where is this company going?"" Doesn't feel secure! Several branches have NEVER been profitable... FOR REAL!!! Do your research before accepting an offer here. Upper management is clueless, many come from smaller equipment dealerships and don't have a clue how to manage or lead, wasteful spending on travel, $$$ meals and with no accountability... It's a free for all, on investor money! How long can this continue??? Did I mention, several branches are not profitable and have never been! Think about it!Free monthly lunch and monthly gift card... highest paying wages in the industryBranches are not profitable and vendors aren't being paid... constantly being placed on credit hold, makes it hard to do businessGreat place to work atThis has to be one of the most rewarding jobs I have worked at. They really care about the employees. The $25 gift card every month is also pretty nice.The month end bbq to make the team buildingWell I learned a lot at work and taught the team the knowledge I know . Management never come to ask questions or check on work just always had negative things to say to me . Getting everyone on board.Great benefitsManagementPositive work environmentI can't speak for all the managers, but the ones I've had the opportunity to work with are pretty awesome. The company is growing very quickly and has some significant growing pains. However, the people here are working hard to figure it out and make it happen.great company culturelack of clear directionExcellentOverall one of the best companies I have ever worked in my career. ES is a people first organization focused on both employees and external customers.Opportunity for growthNoneLots of room to grow and opportunitiesGood company to work for. Has many opportunities for advancements if you’re willing to put in the effort and time. Relocation opportunities are available all over the country.Free snacksNot many breaksRoom for advancementThe company is shifting its direction that was not suitable for me upper management needs more objective people handling the day to day operations they need senior managementGreat place to work with new challenges for growthThis environment is fast-paced, if that's not for you then this isn't the place for you. If it is then it's the best! I feel appreciated and challenged to learn new skills each day and to advance my leadership and career. The people who work at this company are incredibly smart and doing amazing things-it really motivates you to level up.Great colleaguestight deadlines and long hoursSucksBad place to work they don’t let you move up in the company experience is terrible and toxic management just promises and promises and only tell you want you want to hearBetter on the surfaceThe company has good intentions, but poor execution. Lots of nepotism throughout the company. Poor communication across all departments. I wouldn't suggest applying here, job training is non-existing.Worst job everThe company does not give a $&$& about you as an employee and the managers are the worse because if someone in the company is not doing well they make them a manager for some reason all I would say is stay away from renting or being apart of EquipmentShare in any way terrible companyFast Growing Company, Good pay and benefits, Mediocre ManagmentI thoroughly enjoyed my time with Equipment Share. The locations and divisions I worked for had a great culture, good pay, and excellent benefits. There is a bit of the ""Good ol' Boy"" system and preferential treatment but nothing too extreme. My biggest complaint would be the management and lack of training. It doesn't help that the company is constantly rolling out new policies and making changes the their system but is to be expected with a growing company. There have been times when my manager had contradicted himself with operating procedures in the same day. They are still learning, growing, and adjusting. If you can keep up, they are an overall good company to work for though.Terrible management structurePass the Buck mentality here. No ownership. Hostile work environment. No support from management. Human Resources will not have your back with any complaints filed, so don’t bother.Free yearly boots. Uniform serviceHostile work environmentThe best company in the city and beyondThis company cares about the employees and their future in not just the company but any future adventures. The compensation is pretty good for the area and there are lots of opportunities to advance. At HQ you get breakfast and lunch everyday and there are often company sponsored happy hours for anyone to attend.Free breakfast, free lunch, free snacks and drinks. Free company gym. Monthly gift cards for food. Matching 401k, RSUsfun work placeall i can say is i like working at equipment shar ei learned a lot ,,got along fine with coworkers. Each day was some thing new i really enjoyed the challenge...to learnBest Place I have ever worked!This is hands down the best career move that I ever made. The sky is the limit. I feel appreciated, like I am making a difference. Awesome company, awesome people.salary, culture, wellness incentives of amazon gift card or PTO, $25 monthly giftly award every monthnone1Productive and fun work environment and great benefitsGreat place to work awesome staff. All holidays paid off loads of PTO. They even pay some of your gym membership every month. Labor Day Memorial Day thanksgiving and Christmas are company meal provided.Family Dinner gift card once a month for $25New company so a lot of Learning to succeed needed.1Poorly managedManagers are just puppets they have no control over their own stores. Your just a number and your work quality does not reflect your worth. Safety is not important although they will tell you it is. Upside is brand new equipment but it is not maintained as it should be. Promises are just a dream you will not get anything they say you will. Pay for new employees is well above the pay for existing ones.31There is a reason this place is always hiring…Dysfunctional. Chaotic. Stressful.Equipmentshare seems great on the surface, but once you’re there the shine wears off quickly. This place is full of the “we’re a family” mentality, so boundaries mean nothing. Passive aggressive people pretending to be competent but no one really knows what they’re doing.Nice coworkers, decent payI mean…it’s a dumpster fire of a place.Best company I’ve ever worked atThis is the best company I’ve been at in my 14 years. Last 4 years here have been the best ever. I have been given everything to succeed here. You have to try really hard to not make it here . I plan on moving up the corporate ladder here and retiring from this company along time from now. Thanks for allowing me to make a great living for my family.Tools to succeed. Training. Helpful. Great atmosphereEntry level managers and very high turnover rateLeadership will arrive late often. Almost 25% of total workforce is family hires. I quickly noticed that making money on rental contracts has a higher precedence than maintenance and personnel safety. Required proper unit inspections are rushed, will make uncomfortable with passing grades. Customers complain about equipment breakdowns within hours of receipt . The Dispatcher is visibly overwhelmed, combats misinformation, and adjusts on the fly, thusly putting strain on drivers. Customer satifaction is low due to equipment failures, swaps, delivery constraints. You are told Veterans are loved company takes advantage of seasoned work ethic and leadership; but disregards proven abilities to improve workplace product. If you're getting a military pension; will utilize that against higher wages. Pay scale is Cap/Limit style. Why would I provide them 20 loyal years with hope of a raise if I capped out in first year? . I was reassigned to a new position due to no need for 3 Rental Coordinators.They took $3 of my hourly pay without any reprimands or early warning but then posted online a job for Rental Coordinator anyway. Standards are not held equally across the board at this location. Pay is regulated by favoritism. Standard hours are 50 hours weekly (5-10hr shifts). They ask for Saturday volunteers when maintenance loads gets behind due to never enough service technicians. They utilize personsal phone text messages at all hours of the day. Leadership will go weeks without interaction on face to face basis. Micromanaging at its finest; leadership's ability to talk down to itsCatered Friday lunches, free snacks, overtime payLeadership failures, pay scales, favoritism, employees drug program, maintenance process, high turnover rateAbove Average for a rental companyOverall, one of the better rental companies to drive for. Good dispatching, usually pretty understanding. Tons of overtime, so if you don't want to work at least 55-65 hours a week look somewhere else.very good payIT department was terrible., You do everything on your phone and most of the apps were setup to be used on laptop., Application process is EXTREMELY longFast-paced companyThe industry isn't for everyone, but Equipmentshare tries to do what it can to stay ahead of the curve. The telematics team is a good group of individuals that work hard to accomplish what they need.Some of the management team in general needs to have refresher courses/training on how to actually be a manager, they feel content in letting others do the work and claiming all the credit for it, and to sit around collecting a paycheck.But the company as a whole is exciting to work for, and keeps evolving to match the current trends in the industry.Great compensation, horrible management.Upper level management is some of the worst I’ve ever seen or had the displeasure of working with. Pay and benefits are great, but it doesn’t make up for the fact that the whole company is ran like a mom and pop good ole boys operation. Buyer bewarePay, benefitsWork life balance, cliques, bad upper managementSlave labor camp!If you like no time off, no personal life, no freedom, and micromanagement, and being told to do tasks just to be told you messed up by the same person who told you to do that task. Then by all means work for these guys.Lunch on FridayEverything you can think of when it comes to management.Management needs helpService manager is afraid to be a leader. Does not have true leadership skills. General Manager does not get the whole picture of what goes on in the shop and field in the service department. Company has been learning how to run the store since I've started on day 1. Lower leveled mechanics are not taught how to be higher skilled technicians. Dispatcher is 22 and has no business being in that role. Equipmentshare San Antonio soon to be Cibolo needs help.Poor management makes for horrible jobsThis company is fairly new and growing rapidly, with that being said I think that they need to slow down and take the time to do it right. The Ardmore location is a great example. There is only accountability when it comes to certain aspects of the way the business works. There is a total lack of communication between the sales, rental coordinators, service managers, and GM that all extend from the GM of the locationA lot of great peopleChange doesn’t happen when your management team is more buddy buddy than co-workersNot the bestI would stay far away from this company. I have not been paid for 3 weeks and no one will reach out. They suck at management and will not help you in any way on getting the dealNoneNoneRunaway train , nobody in the cabooseLack of management that are qualified. No training involved in their placement . Prisoners are running the jail house. Managers show no integrity or professionalismFree pizza once a monthToxic environmentGreat culture, High stressThe overall culture and team members are amazing. However a “fast paced environment” cannot be understated. Things change on daily if not hourly basis at some points. This along with poor structure made day to day operations difficult.Free breakfast and lunch! Very friendly environmentJob security never felt like it was there since it is a constantly changing environment.Customer serviceOverall good company to work for. Good work life balance. Management knowledgeable and always willing to help. Stocked break room and gave out lots of free stuff.Company looks good on paper, but far from it.Everything started great. I received a competitive offer, but after a Sales Manager was hired I quickly learned that since Equipment Share is such a fast growing company they overlook experienced leadership qualities in some of the managers/employees they hire. The rate of growth is also an area of concern. They are backed by investors and seem to burn through cash rapidly by taking on multiple fronts of product offerings instead of focusing on a main product line to ensure organic growth. I foresee many issues with equipment shortages and the strategy Equipment Share has chosen to compete in an already competitive marketplace.The pay is competitive.HR policies are non existent and management teams lack experience.Impossible to climb their ladder, raises aren’t fairly given, favoritism for their pets, questioned for taking a day offImpossible to advance, your performance isn’t valued, judgement calls are constantly undermined and questioned.Benefits start on hire date, company vehicle if your in the fieldPay, raises, management, on call schedule never followed, co-workers are lazy and will try to set you up for failure.DisappointingThe culture is very closed minded. Click-ish in many ways with vulgar language, crude humor and belittling of employees. The techniques are antiquated and management is unaware and closed minded to other options and possibilities. There is little to no direction or scope of worked lined out. This is hidden by tag line of it being “self motivated” work. The supervisory staff is spineless and non communicative. Employees are vindictive and back stabbing. It was ultimately the worst place I’ve ever worked.Was an excellent company. Local management very big issue.Loved my job for awhile. Company growing fast and the family and friends atmosphere disappearing quickly. Owners have no clue about local Management. If you don't know someone working here you won't advance. It is a yes sir mentality. If you are a yes man and don't ask questions you will do great here. Owners only seem to care about company growth and not what is happening on a local level. I worked with some wonderful people here during my time here. Seen several people fired for severe things and then re hired. Not sure how that happens. Pay is actually pretty good for the type of work. Definitely one of the top paying rental companies. Benefits are getting better and better. Only reason I truly left is the local management and the lack of concern from the upper management about what is happening on a local level.Great pay for the work. Growing company. Decent benefitsLocal management is terrible. Used to be a great place to work. Company growing too fastThis is a friendship-based company not performance basedit’s hard to describe the environment at Equipment Share. It’s a very friend-based company. What that means is if you have friends in high management you’re safe you’ll be rewarded even if you mess up.If you do everything right but not a managers buddy you will become overlooked and miss treated. If you want to be a mechanic don’t work here. That’s not the job they have.Wonderful PTO, parties, monthly company benefitsOverworked underpaid, abuse of power, no recognition for hard workBest Place I have ever worked!This is hands down the best career move that I ever made. The sky is the limit. I feel appreciated, like I am making a difference. Awesome company, awesome people.salary, culture, wellness incentives of amazon gift card or PTO, $25 monthly giftly award every monthnone1Management is terrible including upper management at corporateWas at one time the best company I've ever worked for, but then new management came in and that all changed very fast. It's sad to see such an amazing company go down hill so fast. They promise you things just to get you in but never hold up to the promises. The people they have train you are not up to date on company policies. So when you do what you're trained to do and management changes the policy without letting everyone know they will let you go without any real explanation or second chances. I've seen this multiple times since I've been here. They say they are a family oriented company but will let people go just because the management doesn't like the way you do things. Instead of talking to you to correct it. When you try to talk to upper management they don't call you back and just ignore phone calls. If your family depends on you look somewhere else. Like I said this company was so amazing... but because of power hungry management that all went away very fast. The branch managers treat it like a game and don't care who you are or who depends on you.Nice equipment and trucksNot trustworthy, poor management. Empty promises4Lots of perks/They provide breakfast and lunch to workers. Have an onsite gymnasium and are always having catered events/parties with alcohol for employees and their families. Some during work hours. They allot time for volunteer work. Very casual dress code.Flexible schedule, casual dress code, meals provided, good payNo 401K match, lots of employee favoritism, growth too fast - too much work/not enough staff, inconsistent managers, does not pay vendors timely, minimal training provided2Typical Construction Company AtmosphereLocal management was great! The days are very long, and very stressful but the compensation can make it worth it if that's your goal. Still a startup compared to the big dogs in the industry so that will come with the typical pros and cons.Room for advancement, compensationStressful, some aggravating procedures and growing pains associated with a new company.Great place to work. Love my job and what I do. Management and other employees are great to work with.No complaints. Great company. Wish I would've been here sooner to have been further in the company than I am now. Managed well and are treated better than any other company I've been at.Environment, events, food.NoneDramatic and to many chiefs.Here at equipment share its not about how much knowledge you have wether being for rigs or equipment, your job title is your job title and thats that. They’ll give you hope to move up from the position your in and then go behind your back and hire someone else with the same experience as you if not a little less, your motivation to work here will soon plummet after 6 months of working here due to lack of training, equality, and focus on the other techs they want to excel, if you want a raise good luck the general manager will make up 20,000 excuses on why you should or shouldnt get one. They will yell at you for going on the tool truck to pay your bill and advancing your tools, they will treat you like a kindergartner10/10 do not recommend this place.NoneRead review.Love the challengeI love working with people who want to make their own way and not be like other rental companies. The culture is expected and real! They practice what they preach.Benefits, cultureFun and exciting workplace that is experiencing rapid growth!In the short time that I have been with EquipmentShare, I have been blown away with the company's corporate culture and strategic mission. From day one, I was able to tell that this was not just a company that claimed to value their employees, but they actually put in the work to show us they mean it. Although I was with the company for less than 6 months, I was informed about a position that had opened up that was a better fit for my strengths and needs as an employee and the transition to that position has been amazing! This story is not unique; HR does a great job at matching employees with the right position for their personality, skillset, and goals. I am thankful to wake up and look forward to going into my job everyday, rather than just feeling like I am going through the motions. I truly believe that you will get out of this company what you put into it and I am looking forward to growing with them for the foreseeable future!Free daily lunch, employee gym at headquarters (gym stipend for branches), regular events for employees, lots of room to growNo employee match on 401KHard Work for Mediocre Pay and Poor ManagementThe crew of guys work well together and are always looking out for one another. However, the management does not care about employees and tries to micro-manage everything. Job should pay more considering how much dirty labor it requires out in the scorching heat, the pouring rain, and any other weather.Fun team, stay busy, good exerciseManagement, pay, don’t appreciate employeesThe oerks are good, management has unreal expectationsWhile the perks and benefits are generous, management have unrealistic expectations. They set you up to fail if you do not fit into the click l. Tell them you are drowning in invoices and they just give you more. 2Free breakfast and lunch.Clicky. Goals set too highFun and rapidly growing place to workI've only been working for EquipmentShare for a short period of time; however, in that time I've had the opportunity to move to a department that fit my strengths and personality much better. I am happy to say that my situation is not unique; I believe the Human Resources department does a great job at matching people with the best roles for their particular strengths and personality. I truly believe you will get out what you put into this company and I am grateful that the company is always looking for ways to show their appreciation to their employees. The future of this company looks bright and I am excited for the journey!Competitive pay, numerous employee perks, continued growthExtremely flexible structure (not a real con though).Don't do it!New company only 5 years old, The majority of people at the Lavergne location are family and friends... Favoritism is abundant.I was hired to fire another driver, on my second day.The manager will write you up the first two weeks to mess you out of the 2.00 raise at the end of the 90 days. And will also be looking to get rid of you at the end of the 90 days to repeat the process.If you have mechanical experience they will try to get you in a mechanic role, that has been open for months and they cannot fill.If you are new to rental business they say they will train you they will not. Most of the other drivers will get they're stuff and leave if you don't know what to look for, Good luck.They also will be looking to run you long hours with no breaks. It doesn't matter how much you get done, The new dispatcher will just throw more. The Dispatcher will also throw more deliveries if he knows you have to get off at a certain time.I wouldn't depend on this job if you have a family, You dont know whether you are coming or going on a daily basis.Was resigned without consent.Everything. Dont do it!StressfulWell I was the lead Rental tech and honestly i enjoyed it. Until I had some issues with my family and they let me go because I had to miss some days .Free lunch, company shirtsThere shop is a building with sandProductive and fun place to workGood team and challenging work with industry leading innovation .Positive place to work with good benefits.A place where you have access to new innovations that are leading the industry.Company barbecue and health consciousLunch not paidAlways worry if you will have your job the next dayYou always have to worry if your job is on the line, they well let you go without explanation and lie about the reason why they are letting you go. COVID hit and a lot of people were laid off and told they would have there jobs back when work picked up, but most everyone that were laid off were replaced!Good benefitsJob securityWorse place i ever worked.No backbone, upper management has zero clue how to manage affectivly, from selling tennis rackets to becoming a territory manager, zero support, wasting my life working there, all they want to do is fire people so they look good, owners you need to open your eyes and realize this because of the wrong management choices, and people leaving.Pay okManagement sucksOne if the best places to workAbsolutely one of the best places to work I had a good time working there meet really good people My boss was amazing I love my job only complain I had about it is when we got busy you didn't know what day it was because you're working so much you lost track of time it was absolutely one of the best experiences I've ever had hands down the best company in the rental industry no doubt about it they pay fairly they respect you and you need it on a daily basis your part of a bigger team and they give nothing but encouragement and advancement opportunitiesChristmas party and the family atmosphereNoneSafteyThe company at VB and as a whole actually cares for the employee they are safety driven. Couldn't ask for a better job. Co workers encourage each other as a team to achieve our daily goals.Monthly incentive bonusesA great company that is growing at an abnormal rateIt is a great company and I love working here. I do wish I got paid more as I am the parts manager for the most successful branch we have.Other than that, management is great and are very lenient if you need to take a couple of hours or a day off.Tons of food brought inpay isn't up to parNot goodMansamente dose not care about employees, no team work whatsoever, every one is out for themselves.Nothing makes sense. Constant mis use of company resources.Great people, plenty of work. Lots of OT.People are great, as long as you stay busy and earn your paycheck there are no issues. If you need something all you need to do is ask. Training is offered, but not very often due to work load. Brand new service trucks. Brand new equipment.Free lunches, nobody looks over your shoulder, plenty of work to stay busy.Long hours, new location so some things need done to get shop up and running smoothly."

"Woodward, Inc.","A solid company with room for advancementGreat job with great benefits and compensation, but does not work with people concerning scheduling. When you get hired on it's mandatory to start working the second shift from 3 pm to midnight, so if you are the kind of person who can't sleep after work you pretty much live at night, and good luck working around that if you have to make an appointment1Great companyLots of hours, great benefits including discounts at nearby restaurant chains. Company has a program for sending employees to college with partial or full tuition paid.So many great assets, too many levels of poor management to really be greatDay to day is good and so much to offer. Long term career growth and marketability is terrible. No clear strategic direction from top levels. Not clear on how to be a manufacturing company. Rookie mistakes and tactical efforts put in place to attempt to fix business challenges makes a skilled workforce feel like a bunch of kindergartners. Many people have stayed for a career due to incredible benefits but turnover of the most talented people is also quite high. Diversity is not a thing here. If you don’t look like your leader, don’t expect to be heard here. If that is ok with you, it can be a great place to work.Great work environment, very clean!Pay here sucks for working in the aerospace industry!Very nice people, welcoming environmentLots of room for growth.Cons: having to continue to take courses like in college in a class room setting not learning very much kinda a waste of time in my opinion/ not being paid more for those courses. Also lots of public speaking which can make some feel uncomfortable.Clean, friendly, room for growthPayGood benefitsGood benefits. Insurance and PTO are great. Pay is average. Working conditions are good. Mostly clean work environment. Most managers do a good job keeping you busy.Learning EnvironmentDuring my long tenure I learned a ton and moved up from direct to indirect job code but quickly became maxed out due to lack of education requirements. I was afforded to learn many concepts, strategies, and gain certifications that I can still use for future employment. Overall great company with great benefits.Behind the curve in aerospacePay rate is a bit behind most of the aerospace manufacturing industry due to a lack of union representation. Benefits are strong but the work life balance is hard to deal with. Your shift can be changed to last up to 12 hours and you don't have much of a choice, and you'll probably be working six days a week.Not a bad placePretty good company to work for always treated me well. Management is lacking a bit. Easy to take time off if needed I always got my PTO approved. People there are nice at the Colorado locations.Bad managementNo one is properly trained. The management is very involved in rumors and drama themselves. No one ever get punishment for not doing their job. Way too many people not actimg their wage. It just causes for a bad work environmentGreat company with great peopleExcellent company with integrity and values. The compay is concerned for it's employees and for the community. They take care of their customers, employees, and their facilities.Great peopleNoneOne of the More Respectable Employers in the AreaIt's all about perspective and mindset. In my opinion, Woodward is one of the region's top employers - I've never worked for a better company. I'm proud to be employed here and I would recommended it to anyone.Awesome Benefits, Great Pay, Opportunities for Promotion, Relaxed Work Environment, Good Work CultureLack of WFH Opportunities, Slow to AdaptAverageDecent hours and pay. But the benefits are above average. If you're lazy and want to play on your phone all day, this job is for you. Management does nothing about the worthless employees or those who stare at their phones all day, or run their mouths more than their machines.Well oiled machineThe company runs really well and working for them is pretty structured. Systems in place for everything. Will be asked to pick up extra hours when it gets busy and the compensation is pretty good for a like job. Overall good place.don’t recommend working herei got let go one day after putting in my notice . my boss told the contracting agency that i missed too much work, there’s a team lead in that department who misses 2 days a week on average. work life balance, what’s that? they work you to the bone, if you’re good at your job, they will not let you move up. my boss makes several comments that made me feel uncomfortable and others feel uncomfortable. this is not a professional work space at all. i was told i would work 6:30am-2:00pm and i worked 4:30am-3:00pm, 5 days a week.Do a lot of work for little payWoodward doesn’t stay competitive in the market. They never adjusted for inflation so members are getting paid fast food wages for working on airplane parts. Look at Collins or GE for good pay. Benefits here are great but it’s not really worth it for most when you're getting paid almost half of the competitors.Benefits, vacation timePay, management, flexibility with shiftsA go nowhere jobCome to work and be a computer. Despite never failing anything, I was laid off at the onset of Covid.It was a standard SCM role. Tracking Material and communication with your production team.OK Place to WorkManagement has no idea what's going on most of the time. They don't want to hear anything that is counter to the positive spin they are trying to put on things.Great place to start and learnVariety of work, areas to choose from. Excellent benefits, decent pay. If you are looking to have a career this is the place for you. If you are looking for good work/personal life mix, this is not a good place because of the mandatory overtime weekly, sometimes 7 days a week.Terrible managementWoodward is absolutely failing as a company when it comes to recognizing failures in management, and discord in the line. I have worked here for almost 4 years and the only consistency that comes from working here is stress and agitation. The lack of responsibility and overall respect from Engineers, Ops Specialists, and leaders as a whole makes this place a toxic environment that should not be seeking new members until they weed out the horrible management that continue to let members of the line down habitually.Paid time offDisrespect in the workplace and upper management5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Driving fork liftWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The paperworkWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great everyone is nice and understanding and very helpful when you need itWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Steady pace and nice working environmentGreat benefits - Bad work cultureThere are many hard-working good-hearted people doing their best to make things work. But my impression is the company lurches from one crisis to the next and ignores other problems until, you guessed it, THAT one becomes a crisis. Enough already! They are burning people out.A solid company with room for advancementGreat job with great benefits and compensation, but does not work with people concerning scheduling. When you get hired on it's mandatory to start working the second shift from 3 pm to midnight, so if you are the kind of person who can't sleep after work you pretty much live at night, and good luck working around that if you have to make an appointment1very clean facilities and helpful coworkershave excellent training for on boarding employee. So far, I love working for the company. SAFETY AND QUALITY what woodward is all about, no supervisor is on you for going too slow assembling aerospace part that make qualities of our product excellent. the pay sucks but benefits are amazing.benefits, good mentorshippay sucks51fun and learningthis company is amazing to be with. i learn a lot in this company. The people are very outgoing and willing to help you and train. the pay and the benefit is good as well.learningbi weekly payISO 9000 certified, but they don't practice it. Be prepared for ""Mandatory"" overtime.Woodward is at a major flux point of employment. There was a significant lubricant shortage in Q4 of 2021 that set production back.The employees paid for it. Many quit, and those who stayed were forced to take on overtime. When I started, they were so behind, it took them a month to train me for my job I already started doing.There is a good chance you will be lifting over 50lbs, though they tell you not to.They train you how to report issues that affect your productivity, then tell you to continue without a solution.The valve assembly I did had me lifted a 60lb spring seat to chest height (I'm very tall). When I brought this up to my supervisor it was brushed off.Your time is secondary to Woodward, that being said, they work ya as much as your willing to work, and then some.Productive and fun workplace plus nice clean & safe 🤗Working with Woodward is a great experience & opportunity for your life!🤟🏼 Plus you’ll get great benefits!!!👍🏼 This company is very nice clean & safe!!🤗Good company but management is out of touch with department supervisionMany good things about this company but with the clickie middle & upper management and lack of their contact and knowledge of their department individuals equates to an unpleasant experience and supervisors with favorite employees and unfair treatment of other members.Put your best foot forward, and they'll take care of you.This job can be repetitive depending on what you're doing. Your attitude and work ethic have a massive impact on where you end up and what they have you do (as it does at most companies). I'm currently a Mechanical Assembler, and I've been given extra responsibilities and opportunities because I work my butt off, show up on time, ask questions and own my mistakes if I make them. Now, my job is not as repetitive. I work on units that have been damaged and need repairs, and that makes the day go by much quicker.Supervisors and Specialists have been very kind and supportive, giving me any tools and advice I need to do my job. Overtime is great and is voluntary. They're fairly lenient when it comes to taking time off and sick days.The culture here is good, but just like any other place, be careful in who you decide to become friends with.Assemblers are in the Union, but not much happens as far as I've seen. Hopefully they're honest and upright.Benefits/Vacation are fantastic from day 1.I don't have enough experience yet to say whether or not raises/promotions are fair, but I have a feeling they will be.The hardest part about this job is simply the commute for me. I live about an hour away, and traffic is a nightmare on the way home.The most enjoyable part of this job is there's always something new to learn. Aviation is a massive industry and in my honest opinion, no one can know everything about it. However, you can try!Supportive Managers, Overtime, Benefits, Vacation(Personal) Work-life balance, Certification process, Union confusionGreat pay and progression through the companyGreat place to work. The pay is very good andyou are given opportunity to progress throughthe company. Great benefits too. People are friendly and willing to help out.Good pay and benefitsshort lunchCo workers are supportiveClean place to work.Management changed…no communication and your just a number now.Clean place…no follow thru on finishing projects or updating areasNot much else to sayClean placeNo communicationPoor Compensation, Dead End JobCompensation is poor and not competitive with the local market. There is no promotion from within. If you are interviewing, ask for the top end of the range because once you're in the door that's the best you'll do.Paid HolidaysCompensation, Weak LeadershipLeadership is sub parManagement focuses solely on metrics and charts. Work place culture is lazy, ignorant and unsupportive. Pay is way above average if you are in the union and the benefits are great! There is no faith or respect for leadership. Outlook at this facility is bleak.great pay and benefits if you are unionmanagement does a horrible job, constant turnover of leadership and poor planningI'm not one of these wimps that get to stay home and ""work"". I'm a production worker and these questions are ridiculous.Woodward is great, you get in as much as you put out and the culture isn't oppressive in its wokeness at all. We all know how the sausage is made and it isn't by the wimps in the offices with their meetings about meetings and lazy work from home culture. The production side (95%) is great, especially if you come from a small job shop. We have break rooms, cafeteria, organized and well managed structure, great benefits, cheap insurance and they appreciate hard work, if you do it. Not like these stay at home office dweebs. The Pandemic really showed who gets it done and those who can't fix a flat tire before their latte.Not too bad. Easy work. Might be difficult to get that raise.So so place to work at. The work is easy. The place is clean. You can't be fired that easily. You have to suck up if you want that raise. Other than that not too bad.Socialist pay scale but good benefitsOverall working at woodward was a decent experience. The amount of knowledge to be gained is there if you look for it. The downfall of the job is people who are doing more arent really appreciated monitarily, and the pay really isnt competitive as they claim it to be. Ops techs running complex machinery are paid the same as ops techs doing assembly or sub assembly putting in stis or lee plugs all day. The benefits are competitve. Supervisors are generally helpful and HR works diligently to ensure that its a safe and inclusive work environment. Overall, Id say its a good starter job for younger people with little to no experience, and great if you delve into complacency, with not making very much, as far as having a good retirement plan goes.its a stable jobthe benefits and money are good. lots of overtime every week and most Saturdays voluntary occasionally mandatory. its easy once you get it downpacked but the training was terrible. I don't know if it was just my department or what but once I got to the floor I was basically on my own. the workers who have been there for the longest are expected to do double the work trying to train you and get as many parts down the line as possible, so basically it's virtually impossible for you to get any training not to mention most of the workers were upset about the company betraying them over bonuses that they didn't even want to bother with training you. why wouldn't you just have one designated person to train the new people instead of making them do double the work trying to get as many parts down the line as possible? like what?? how do you get proper training like that? the whole system of transferring into a new hire was complete chaos. my supervisor didn't know anything, HR doesn't know anything either. any answer they give you is either I don't know or just a vague answer that doesn't answer anything at all. any question you have about working there basically can't be answered because nobody knows anything. I've had to just lead my own way. it's whatever it's a simple job but they really do the bare minimum with the new hires that would be expected at any job you start and don't explain anything about how their company works and good luck if you have questions about any of it because nobody has an answer for youpay, benefitschaotic, no work and life balance, expects too much of workers for little to no compensationOnly one thing good about this company, the benefits!Too much favoritism when it come to job rotation. The lead there has no concept with streamlining production which leads to unnecessary overtime. There are favorites that don’t get rotated fairly which leads to animosity among the workers!CoworkersLead PersonHoilday block leave insurance benefitsholiday block leave,and how they treat there employees, bought us lunch, employee turn over rate down, they pay well, and great managers, happy employees.Holiday block leave, insurance benefits and set schedules, free lunches.short staffed.If your looking to succeed or level up at woodward, this company isnt for you. There is alot of favortism.There is alot of favortism in this company. Ive been working here for a year. Tried applying whithin the same company more times than you can count. They keep you in the same level for a long time and always make excuses and find reasons why they cant give you a higher level or get a better position.Good benefitsNot fair in pay rate. Alot of favortism in this company.Easy job,show up, you will not get fired.Woodward will low ball your wages every time, no matter how hard you work your top out end of yr raise will not be more than 2.49 percent. In ft Collins what's the point keep your change folks. During pandemic and spouses could have been loosing jobs they took away end of yr bonuses that could help families. Also they hire new employees at a higher rate than seasoned dedicated employees. New employees should work up to their rate. Don't work here.You can always work overtime in addition to the 5 10 he shifts, so you can take more time away from your familyHR is clueless, mngmnt stares at their computer all day, has no ideas on how to actually perform the job you are doingGreat pay and benefitsGreat job and good people work there. I wish I had more time at the company but things didn’t work out. Very important complaint in aerospace manufacturing.BenefitsI don’t work there anymoreMediocre at bestMost of the people are fun to work with and willing to share their knowledge. This company will make you work whatever overtime and most Saturdays to meet shipment needs.Since the bean counters took control of the business ~25 years ago, this company strives to just be slightly below average on pay and benefits. They have intentionally cut all of their benefits to be par with the lowest industry standards that the thought they could get away with. But, the bean counters have been able to keep their stock prices and dividends at an above average return, which keeps the stockholders and upper management happy. Upper management's bonus (member incentive pay) is directly tied to the companies stock performance. So, if the company stock does well, upper management's bonus (member incentive pay) is significantly higher than the worker's bonus (member incentive plan). However, the vast majority of the employees' (members') bonus is intentionally setup to stringently cap / control their bonus (member incentive pay). If the companies' stock does unexpectedly good in any one year, the companies' board members can and will intentionally reduce the worker member's incentive payout.If you want Woodward to pay for education reimbursement, there is a big catch in this policy to be wary of. If you take their money and you don't get a full degree and if you don't stay 5 year after your diploma, you will have to pay it all back to them when you leave the company. So, where is the incentive to take a few college level courses to get ahead in your career? Because, you will be forced to payFriendly coworkersmandatory overtime, poor pay, mediocre benefits, hard to advance positions and payA solid company with room for advancementGreat job with great benefits and compensation, but does not work with people concerning scheduling. When you get hired on it's mandatory to start working the second shift from 3 pm to midnight, so if you are the kind of person who can't sleep after work you pretty much live at night, and good luck working around that if you have to make an appointment1Was a great...not so much nowIt started as an amazing company/culture. Sadly it has created much division, favoritism and long time members of the company no longer speak highly of the company. They stress integrity, respecting individuals, morals and ethics and then toss that all out the window. They don't respect people and if they can't strong arm you, the will make you miserable and will go as far as changing your work hours without warning you or just fire you.some people are awesome...not manyleadership doesn't listen, leadership encourages division, leadership shows favoritism, supports unconstitutional requirements, say they promote learning/advancement but in reality they don’t. .2Not goodNot good because they hire you and fire you in the same time span. I was hired as a contractor and was laid off only 3 months because work got slow.2NoStarted taking stuff away from the workers. Very stressful. If they liked you then you could do whatever and you wouldn’t get into trouble. But if they didn’t like you they would be very negative to you.Government Mandate EnforcersIf you submit to the government's illegal mandate, you deserve 0/5 stars. This used to be a small company driven toward the employees, now it's just another government subsidized . Requiring a vaccine that doesn't even work is preposterous.NaCorporate socialismProduction drivenGood place to work, good benefits, and bonuses. They like to push to hit numbers. They give you everything you need to get the job done. It is a clean air conditioned shop.Very awful company to work for please don't apply wish i could give no starsReally was an awful time working for woodward, i was asked to wear too many hats and do the work of 5 people. but the people in charge didnt care, happy to overload you with too much work and tell you off and complaint when you struggle to get the work donecompany expects you to complete the work of 5 people even if that means you working 7 days a week or in some cases working for free if no overtime is authorisedPeople only stay for the benefitsNothing comes to mindEverything very awful company to work forNo AdvancementAll kinds of empty promises made. I was misled The Whole time I was here. There is no advancement here. I see people in the same jobs for 10+ years without growing.Casual EnvironmentIt sucksDecent place to work at.Woodward is a good company to work for in the Rockford area. They have a decent starting wage and good benefits. They treat their employees with respect and is a clean working enviroment. I would recommend working here if you are looking for a career in manufacturing.Stressful work environmentSupervisor was great, but the directors expect more than possible work loads. Mandatory overtime when there’s no work available, so standing around doing nothing.BenefitsHours, payGood companyOverall good company. Knowledgeable people. Most are willing to help out. Felt a sense of purpose, not just a job. I learned a lot while I was there.Most people had good attitudesGood place to get your foot in the doorGood place to gain experience with manufacturing processes. Wages could be better, but this slight lack of pay is offset by amazing benefits. Great work culture in regards to fellow members on the shop floor.Good PayThe company calls their employees “members” because they like to make it seem like we are important to them, but they don’t care about us at all. Mandatory overtime depending on your department. Some of us are on 10 hours every week so they definitely don’t care about balancing work and home life. During the pandemic they fired over 400 employees regardless of seniority. Management is a joke to communicate with as there is never any transparency. The money/benefits are all good but the job really just wears you down over time.Pay, health insurance, 401K, vacationMandatory overtime, no flexibility, no understanding, deceitGreat untill company moved stateThis was a great place to work until that company gave us the exit strategy for leaving California. Record profits and the company doing well as a supply chain to Airbus and Boeing. They promised us the world if we achieved and I guess moving state was the world to them. Devastated on the news of the move was an understatement to say the least. While I was there great company although do not think I could ever return after the Woodward Dump.Horrible placeHorrible place to work at. Management is sooo horrible. Everyone here is so nosy and they spread rumors faster then wild fire. Don’t work here. This place is horribleSuper Lean company with a focus on products not peopleToo lean to actually function. They let go of so many people as the pandemic started and refused to hire more even after the industry is showing signs of picking back up.A lot of management that doesnt do anything. Multiple engineering groups cannot agree so production doesnt know how to build all the time and have to figure it out on their own.Cancelled bonuses and pay is low for the area.Benefitsnot enough people, management, pay, supportStockhandlerAbsolutely no advancement options for Stockhandlers. Yet they are hiring through a Temp agency. Instead of giving Stockhandler an opportunity to apply for Op Tech positions. It's a joke.NoneAlotWoodward is not the place it used to beWorked 30+ years for them, and was laid off due to Covid, even though the stocks were going up. Instead of treating the employees well, they decided to line the pockets of the shareholders. Used to be a family company, but ever since it went public, they started treating members horribly. Outsourcing to other countries, laying people off, and handing out meager raises, while the stock went up. I was eager to advance my career, however the training they promised me to do so, kept getting put off, because everyone was too busy to do it.BenefitsLong Hours, poor raisesLow work volume and dull environment.This company has taken a massive fall since covid. Between having absolutely no work for months, and a pay freeze that’s expected to last until the end of 2022, there’s little here that excites anymore. Quality employees working for minimum pay. Bottom of the industry starting pay when compared to other aerospace companies in the area. No bonuses or really any incentives. I’d look elsewhere until the aerospace industry rebounds. Woodward is NOT a premier employer any longer.Great benefitsShort lunch, no work, pay freeze, lowest compensation in industryBenefits are the primary reason anyone staysI'm peaking from the production side of the company. While there are several benefits such as good health/dental insurance and even Tuition assistance, over the years these gradually been getting worse. The pay is mediocre considering the amount of time you'll be expected to give to them. That said, if you like over time, they usually expect plenty. As for moving up, you'd be better of making friends than working hard or caring about your product/productivity. You'll likely be stuck in the same position for many years. Management will complain all day about various problems, but don't expect them to take the time to actually understand what the issues are, or how to fix them.benefitsManagement, career advancement, problem solvingMixed BagWasn’t the worst job but also has a lot of room for improvement. The micromanagement from certain supervisors can drive you batty and the culture can be very backstabby and cut throat when it comes to non conformance reports. A lot of finger pointing and no one wants to take accountability out of fear of poor performance reviews. Upper management let’s **** roll downhill so to speak. As a corporate entity, Woodward seems to propagate the trend -as it seems many corporations do- of attempting to extract the most out of it’s employees without much in return, you will be required to perform duties above one’s paygrade, out of one’s job description. As an Op Tech you are opted into an obligational tier based level progression system. Not meeting specific requirements for level progression looms the potential for termination. Requirements for MAINTAINING one’s level and progression include annual process improvement projects while also attempting to balance sometimes unrealistic workloads. In theory it doesn’t sound too bad on paper, but the execution of these projects are heavily laden with buerocratic red tape, and headaches. It takes time away from production to have a pretty presentation to someone who gets paid to draft up said projects. *cough* not to mention many employees draft up bs that doesn’t need fixing just to have done something. When it comes to actual production a lot of cherry picking occurs if you know how to work the system...so if things look good in the system, laziness can look like excellence and excellence can look like laziness. It really depends on whatHealthcare Benefits, Cafeteria On Site, Some Decent PplSystemic Issues, Micromanagement"
CACI,"Nice place to workThis is a great company to work for, benefits are great in terms of medical and time-off.Management has been great, its easy to advance to other areas. They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free.84Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice!1 starWhat is the best part of working at the company?NOTHING, POOR PAY, BAD MANAGEMENT, NEED A LAWYER IF YOU WORK THEREWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?LOW WAGES, COMMUTER, TRAVEL, HAVE TO FIGHT THE COMPANY TO GET WHAT YOU DUEWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?CUBLICS, TEMP, BAD WORK ENVIRONMENT, SICK, COUGHING EMPLOYEES IN OPEN FLOOR PLANSWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?TOO HOT, TOO COLD, TOO LOUD, TOO CHEAPHelp Desk SpecialistA job that you take for the experience people dont stay here longer than 6 months usually people just come and go its a clock in and clock out type of job management doesnt really care about anything other than meeting SLAs1Good pay, solid crewGreat management, and the work is steady. You’re expected to work most of day, but they don’t stress you out about how early you need to be there, or how long you stay. You need to produce work. Turn hours, make money. Don’t turn, don’t make money. Simple5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?CACI, Inc tend to stay up to date with their policies, procedures and facilitate a good working environment free of clutter. The best thing is that they care about helping their staff grow and expand whenever possible. No one is left alone or ignored. Great management and supervisors (at least at my level)What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Unfamiliarity with practices, but this is something one experiences in any career. Failing and struggling is a part of life we all cannot escape. The good thing regarding CACI is that we have team players that want me to succeed. It can be hit or miss at times …that’s just a part of life :)What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very good! My office assures that all practices and social guidelines are current and free of distraction for all people.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Guidelines and assignments are mostly self-driven. 8 hour days, mostly telework. CACI is really good about allowing for a clutter-free atmosphere.Good job if you have multiple sources of incomeI wouldn’t recommend this being your only source of income working as a background investigator. I have been with the company for 3 and a half years and there have been multiple stretches of 4-6 weeks where there just isn’t any work available and the company puts you on leave with out pay. My section lead is great and so are the more senior investigators in the region. Work life is balance is great. Review is inconsistent so reports will be good one day and bad the next. The metrics for production make it very difficult to meet goals. Overall the pay is decent for what it is, just don’t expect to really grow in this position. This is great for someone who is retired or has multiple sources of income.AwfulCompany has a toxic environment and no support , poor training , unrealistic goals no manager support and or training programs. Huh pressure to over work. No respect for life events.Great Opportunities and benefitsCACI has a very diverse and progressive environment, however, the management really sucks in my opinion. There seems to be a disconnect in their values and vision versus that of the team. No real morale boosters, and hosted outings that you have to pay for on your own. lolBenefits, diversity, growth opportunitiesManagement, No free lunches, politicsGood company to build a careerBenefits and engagement with employees are amazing. I like that there are opportunities, depending on location, for growth within the company. This is good for a person looking to build a career. There is always someone to talk to for any technical issue within the system and problems are taken care of quickly.- Salary: The salaries are lower than most and expected.- Onboarding: I was confused. The process isn't explained well. There is a person assigned to be a mentor during Onboarding. This person never contacted me.Nothing to addGreat benefits package. 401K could be better but pretty good. Overall, it's a good place to work. Excellent staff always willing to pitch in and give help whenever and wherever its needed.Three years of work at this company, and then laid offThe business group where I worked was not the best work environment. When the layoffs were announced, management was less than forthcoming, and its practices were not the best..I learned a few things about corporate cultureManagement practicesWorst management I have every labored underThere was a severe disconnect between management and between the team that I worked on, to the extent that we were left completely to our own devices. Until a crisis arose, at which time we were blamed for the crisis and there was a huge blow up during a meeting. In 25 years in the tech business I have never had such a negative experience as this.Okay, but poor pay on the Investigations sideDidn't keep up with inflation, and doesn't seem interested in continuous examination of benefits or pay scale to keep competitive. Definitely a good field to work in, but the pay is just not there for a national security position coupled with the high stress of micromanagement.Work from homeHigh turnover and micromanagementGreat Company from Start To FinishFantastic company with transparent and caring management. Great benefits and career development resources. Leadership has shown through, most notably in navigating work during the pandemic and encourages professional growth. Spectacular company to work for all around.Management was very supportive of peopleWas an IT contractor for many years after retiring from the military. As a contract worker, you tend to get frequently laid off at the end of a contract. CACI was the only one that really made an effort to place their employees within the firm.CACI gave us training to allow us to grow the skills needed to qualify for future jobs. I learned classified information about multiple government agencies which was very interesting. The hardest part of the job was the long hours required to perform software testing. Always a crunch time to test and field software.Training, management supportLong hours - routine 10pm and weekendInteresting place to workWorked for almost 5 years on different programs. No issue changing to any open position. There is no way I would be able to answer this question with any knowledgeWeek ManagersManagers with poor management/ leadership skills.A manager that stand by and watch/ hands off is not a leader in my opinion. That is what you get at CACIWorst company EVERI do not recommend this job to anyone, not even my worst enemy! There’s major favoritism. The manager picks out 1 person & bullies & picks on them. There’s no help from the manager at ALL when short staffed. He’s all about himself. If it’s not his way, it’s no way. Management never investigates, just keeps picking on that one employee. Most of the time it was like being in high school all over again.Staff is required to work while being sick and NO training at all! Worried about production and paperwork than quality. Office ran by a micromanaging managers who never gives any positivity only negativity and knows nothing about running a professional office. Management needs to get in-touch with staff. Their polices do not fit all the circumstances that involve the office. Management have their own way of doing things. The staff trying to please ONE PERSON ONLY!!!There is just too much unprofessional things going on. A lot of gossip in the office with Management cover up. Pay is horrible and will have you overwhelmed!A typical day at work consisted of non stop working. There is no teamwork. Upper management will not help you. The hardest part of the job is constantly being told that you are under staffed, however no one is able to complete their job. Upper management will lie and/or make false promises repeatedly. The regional managers are a joke!!! This company is a joke. It is ran by people who have no clue what they are doing. If you have a family or a life outside of work, I do not advise you to work with them. PLEASE RUN!!!!!Enjoyed the Job; Leadership needs workI loved working background investigations. Work/Life balance in the sense of going to doctor appointments without have to ask permission was fantastic. My section lead was hands down the best supervisor I ever had and my team was great. Leadership on the other hand is questionable. A couple things that leadership told the investigations division was alarming.This is what we were told:1. First day in the academy- “You are just a number and easily replaceable.”2. “Since work is low, you’ll need to use your PTO if you want a better paycheck.”3. “We have created a tier ranking system within investigations so you’ll have to compete against your colleagues to get work and make a living.” This caused people to quit because they couldn’t afford rent and were living out of their car.4. “We are thoroughly disappointed in all of you for losing the #1 contract spot. We expected much more and we really hope you do better or else….” Turns out it was the bidding teams error. They bid too high so it wasn’t the investigations division fault.5. When asked if investigators could apply elsewhere within the agency because we didn’t have any work due to an agency transition leadership stated on a call: “You know, the other positions within CACI require a certain level of education and experience that Background Investigators just don’t have.”CACI will probably deny all above. I remember every persons name that told us those things, all of which were on monthly leadership calls. Being told all of those things made the job difficult.The metric system is nearly impossible to meet unlessVery productive and encouraging. Very peaceful environment. EveryoneExcellent working environmentUrdu manager was excellent. workshops were offered to upgrade our skills. Tech support was always there. Everyone was there to help and support each other. The working environment was excellent.RunI do not recommend this job to anyone, not even my worst enemy! There’s major favoritism. The manager picks out 1 person & bullies & picks on them.

We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice!It was a positive, professional place to work .CACI won a military contract in the Middle East. CACI contracted everyone and offered a position back.CACI knows how to do there job. Very professional and wanted to work with you .ExcitingGood companyto work for, strong pay. The benefits couls be a little bit better but other than that it is a good company. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for an exciting opportunity.Great Company to work for.No complaints on the culture. I worked on a unique project so my experience may vary. The contract I worked on required long hours deployed. Everyday was something different.Paid very wellTravelDuplicitous Upper ManagementDuring the 2019 to 2021 time frame, CACI over-hired Background Investigators. When the BI backlog was reduced, rather than having a reduction in force and paying unemployment benefits they put investigators on Leave without Pay. CACI wanted investigators to leave voluntarily (not getting work and not being paid was pretty big motivator for doing so). Which investigators got the limited case work was dependent on a metrics system that forced investigators to work undocumented hours (usually on weekends) to get the Weighted Testimonies per Day metric up. This made you a higher Tiered investigator and you continued to receive work assignments (though at times not enough for a full 40 hours). It soon became apparent that a lot of investigators had undocumented work hours and overtime in order to meet CACI’s metric and continue getting case assignments.All in all very reprehensible on the part of CACI management. They achieved two things, 1) not having to pay unemployment expenses by not having a reduction in force; 2) increased output from the investigators remaining because of undocumented additional work (unpaid overtime). CACI management knew this was happening, it was obvious to even the level 1 investigators. As a retiree I had other sources of income, my CACI investigator job was just additional income. However, I found I could no longer be part of this absurd pretense and resigned (use my weekends for other things).My immediate supervisor was a good manager.Duplicitous upper management.Another Defense ContractorThis is just another defense contractor, no deference. About 30 days of vacation, no bonus, good 401k match. Quality of life varies from group to group.BoringYou might be happy if you’re looking for a boring, low-stress place to coast until retirement. Seems like this place is stuck in the past.The pay is less than what you’ll get with similar contractors or technology companies. No talk of raises or bonuses in the time I’ve been here despite huge contracts and profit.18 days of PTO for first 5 years and increases by 2 days for every 5 years after. Caps at 25 days after 15 years. 10 holidays. 4 weeks parental leave.50% 401(k) match up to 8%. Vests after 3 years which is a really annoying way to pressure people into staying.No option to work 4/10 schedule.4 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Very good benefits.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I can't think of an stressfulness related to CACI.It's like buying a car and you won't find out what's wrong until its too late.CACI is dishonest with New Hires and the benefits they offer. The company will take advantage of you in the following ways.My recommendations are:-Don't trust other CACI employees unless you plan to spend money, socialize and become ""friends"" they all had to go through the same stuff I did below and that's how they operate to survive.-Don't use CACI's Relocation program.It is cheaper to put your stuff in storage and get everything when you arrive overseas.-Have 10,000.00 in Savings or on Credit available as you will be paying for your own transportation, and hotel stay until you find an apartment and CACI decides to allow you to be reimbursed which takes a long time as it has to be done a specific way and without error. Otherwise it will take months to get reimbursed as your requests will get kicked back constantly.-The company depends on one person for transportation when you first arrive and you will have to use public transportation after that. There was no assistance with any of the errands except for when I was in-processing and they expect you to just show up to work.Relocation - Instead of giving the new hire the money and allowing them to make reasonable decisions, CACI, hires a ""third party"" and gave them your relocation money to spend as they see fit. This person scheduling and providing relocation will overspend as much as possible to make sure you stay at least a year or else you will have to pay it all back.All of the costs for my relocation were unreasonable and its like they went with the most expensive tickets and expensive companies theyI experienced a different country. They pay the rent at least.This position is not worth anyone's time unless you are just starting out in Information Technology, like to party and socialize.Not a bad place to startIt was an IT helpdesk. Days were typically very busy. My regret was staying there and stagnating for as long as I did. Pay was alright. Benefits were ok. My coworkers were amazing. CACI paid for school and certs. Vacation time was a little lacking from my discussions with other IT employees at other companies. My biggest problems in an otherwise decent job, was that I had literally 5 bosses whom didn't like/talk to each other. I got conflicting information a lot and it was stressful. The other negative was that there was no room for advancement at the specific job that I was working. I had to leave to get a decent pay raise. Those criticisms are likely unique to that helpdesk job though. I'd have no problem going back to work for CACI in the future.Tuition and certificate reimbursement, healthcare was great, the people were amazingManagement and a lack of upward mobility3 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?I've been working here for a couple years now and the growth is amazing. Great commander and commander of my life.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Honestly, learning the new systems and being efficient. A lot of important information is passed through you. You have to learn who can have access to what and who doesn't.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's really military environment. Something similar to USAA.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I mean your regular office job. Work on computers. Taking phone calls and auch.4 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Company made improvements to their HR and technology in there years I was there. They are finally starting to act like the big boys in government contracting.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Contract situation of projects. But that's at all government contractors. The contracts I was on always seemed to be ending soon or had issues with extensions. Things got done pretty last minute on the gov. side. They do try to get employees who are loses coverage on a contract to work on other contracts.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Most folks are 100% billable, so you just work on your contract. Not a lot of company time given to development outside of what you are working on. Any hours you spend on 'fun' stuff is not billable and would be on your own time. The company is focused on delivering for their customers, which it does a good job of.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Again. Contract dependent. A lot of folks who work for the company are off-site/client-site. I was lucky to be at a company facility my whole time and the office environment is friendly and laid back.Solid Company with Great leaders, good benefits, and lower than average payI loved working for CACI! My program and deputy program managers were fantastic! The pay was a bit lower than should be expected from my time and position but the benefits were nice. Leave was good too. They are VERY military friendly. The biggest difficulty was that they are a contracting company which means that once a contract goes away you have to work to find a new position. However, they were very helpful in the process and very flexible in changing contracts. Definitely recommend them.CACI truly promotes life-long careers and gives you the resources needed to create our ideal careers.Overall good company to work for especially if you are willing to put in the effort. Could be stressful at times but overall not a bad fit and lets you work remote as well.Ability to work remote.A lot of travel with my job.Always family first with the company. Great managers.Flexible hours if needed.Nice people to work forNice benefits if neededtelecommute optionsFun people to work withThey have a great 401 k plan.Lost sight of the customers needsThis company spent more time worrying about making reports look pretty, than the actual work the customer contracted us for and consequently, the customer dropped the contract.Plus grading investigators should be manager responsibility not Reviewers. If you have laptop issues many times it has to be shipped back.Upper management stinks! They and team leads have favorites. Production and metrics huge issue except for favorites! Too many managers and team leads.great placegreat place to work. very interesting programs. managers are good with their employees. PTO is great. balance work and life is awesome. make your own hoursOkay job but not greatPros:- Decent pay and benefits- Stable work scheduleCons:- A lot of micromanaging when I worked there- Had to stare at a bright screen in a dark room all day- Very monotonous workGreat Work Life Balance at a CostYou won’t find better work life balance. Time flexibility, no micromanagement, decent individual autonomy on tasks.The real problem is the pay, as well as the fulfillment gained from the work. This is less to do with CACI, and more the nature of government work.You may work for years on products that will never be used, all the while being underpaid in relation to public sector work.Work life balance, low stress, no micromanagementPay, sense of purpose in the government machineRewarding jobIt’s a great company to work for, especially for entry level. I was able to get a friend hired also through their referral program. It does require a security clearance which can be a pain.Nice place to workThis is a great company to work for, benefits are great in terms of medical and time-off.Management has been great, its easy to advance to other areas. They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free.84Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice!Productive and great place to work.Theirs nothing bad about this company,not as long as i was working there.Upper management works with you,gives meaningful informaton about task at hand. Plenty room for advancement. people are friendly.Enjoyable place to work.My title was site manager for mail contract to fort monmouth and surrounding area. .I enjoyed my time with CACI,and fellow employees.1Leadership needs improvementI worked for CACI fo 19 1/2 years, in that time 1 promotion, saw others receive multiple hired a deputy outside of the company who had left under difficult conditions. Higher leadership is either blind or doesn't care what local managers do or require. The level I worked at was like a subsidiary of CACI. No one from the outside the local area visited more than 3 times my entire tenure.Never denied time off or PTOLeadership, Lack of, in the beginning nepotism, then cronyism and finally narcissism1Busy, exciting, a place where I learned new experiencesMy day was pretty busy, I learned how to troubleshoot various issues, my lead was the best, the workplace culture was relaxing and enjoyable to work in. The hardest part for me was if I did not know how to troubleshoot, I had use my researching skills to find out how to assess and fix the issue. My hours, oh the hours.Experiences I learnedNo Cons for meManagement sometimes has high expectations for their field investigators.Field Investigators are highly trained by CACI to perform their duties with the US Department of Defense, Defense Counter-Intelligence, and Security Agency. High expectations with their reports for the government.Good benefits.Hard to be promoted without good metrics.Great workplace. People are friendly and helpful.I absolutely love my job and everyone I work for and around. I am given the opportunity to learn new skills which only affords me the opportunity to advance.I wish the company would offer raises and/or bonuses on an annual basis.Local management always willing to work with you. Corporate management seemed to always be more interested in making our jobs harder.Local management always willing to work with you. Corporate management seemed to always be more interested in making our jobs harder. Corporate management hurt local business.Great local managementDeadlines deadlines caused by unrealistic schedules.No work/life balance. Societal bias within management and at corporate.Diversity was seen as a task and not truly embraced by the company. We were required and tracked to fill out survey for company to make the top 50 company listing. Management wasn'tLots of Job Security but, no advancement for Contract workers.You get all of the federal holidays and you can reasonably set your own hours (5-8hr days, 4-10hr days, 4-9hr & 1-4hr day).CACI is a big enough company that the work seems to be consistent, I never worried about downsizing. The work can get a little pressured at times when the work load increases but, management is very reasonable about how much work can be done in a day (you are compared to others in similar positions by various metrics) and as long as you are in the average range they leave you alone to do the work.Fantastic GIS experience with a company that is extremely well-known in the industry.The big downside is they like to hire a lot of contract workers (I was hired through Aerotek) and those contract workers have very little to no chance of moving into a permanent CACI position. Some of the other contract workers had been there for over 2 years, I only stayed a year.Industry recognition, holidays, flexible hoursContractors will stay contractorsGood stepping stone to a clearance and a better job. You will work off the clock if you don't want to get fired.Think of a position as a Background Investigator as a 1-3 year stepping stone to a clearance and a better job and you'll be fine. You will work off the clock if you don't want to get fired.Remote with good payFlexible schedules, good pay and opportunity for growth. Company culture is very important so there's periodic evaluations to make sure you're happy.nothing specialNothing special , low pay, low security, poor benefits, no encouragement, no career, no promotion, nobody cares you, you are just tools for profit, avoid this company!NoneLow payManagement is Terrible in OKCIf I could have given a negative rating to the management at CACI I would have. They micromanage, treat you like a child and have terrible double standards. This is a great place to work if you like you brown nose instead of do your job. Imagine the worst place you have ever worked this is more than likely worse.Good BenefitsTo many to list them allThe work is importantClients would agree to a workplan and when the team arrived on site the managers would change the plan. Then they blamed the facilitator for not achieving the objectives.working in a cubicleOverall it wasnt bad when I worked for them.The group I worked with was a good team. It was a demanding job, but you had to learn how to prioritize your work to ensure it was done on time. You did have those investigator that did not like feedback, when they did not have enough information in their reports.Toxic Work EnviromentCACI, Fayetteville NC is a very toxic work environment that host a plethora of clicks and internal relationships up to the Program Manager. Inappropriate language and jokes are made by members of the Management and disciplined by the management to employees. Junior Managers are allowed to disrespect other department employees and managers with no action taken. Senior Managers are discouraged to make corrective action to employees for failure to properly conduct their jobs. Yet same employees are allowed to complain to Program Manager for very reason being corrected for and the managers are nearly always told to back down. Every day from multiple departments within are complaints to HR. The most I have seen in a very long career. Never have I seen such a toxic Program which gives a real bad name for CACI which in general is a great company. Corporates unfortunately is blind to what is really happening with this program in Fayetteville NC.Will work you to deathCACI in the beginning will start you with a low salary as a Investigator I and tell you it’s really simple to get to Investigator II which will be a huge difference in salary. Basically, they put a carrot in front of you to chase. The only problem is you will have to put in huge amounts of time to be promoted to Investigator II. Logically CACI understands if you are learning the job it would take well over a year to become productive enough to work at the Investigator II level unless you work extra to learn the job but only bill them for 40 hours. They know anyone who produces enough work to be promoted to Investigator II did so with a ton of time being worked and not reported. Before, I started with CACI I read reviews that said the same thing but I discounted them. You have the option to do the same.Work from home, good place to improve your skills because CACI expects perfection in the work you submit.Long hour to increase your pay.Sorry managementThe management does not care about its people at all. I worked overseas and management lead by threats of termination, “you can and will be replaced “NoneStay awayGood place to work. My direct manager was horribleIt's one of those situations where the company as a whole is good, but if your direct manager sucks, then it makes the job suck. It just isn't good for me based on my experience thus far. The workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is the managers not listening to your recommendations when you have had more experience with the exact scenario that they are going through.Pay, work schedule, benefits, missionLower level managementGreat company, poor decisionsWas a great company until they decided to roll over make it mandatory for everyone to be vaccinated. I wonder how many people will be left when the deadline rolls around. Good luck.Interesting. Management was helpful when assistance was neededOverall, a good company to work for. Co-workers were helpful and accommodating for leave coverage. With contract work, job security is always questionable."
Salesforce,"Bad territory PIPGot PIP at mulesoft. Manager did not help much wuth helping me achieve target. Remote is great, a lot of flexibility. Coworkers were good.

Culture is still very much majority focused with fake caring about minorities. Low pay for work and stress levels. Better paying tech companies elsewhere.Amazing community to be a part of!I started my career at Salesforce in Sales and moved into recruiting after two years. I absolutely loved my time in the Sales organization, and it's true what they say about getting your ""Salesforce MBA"" - the way they teach you to approach a sale/company is incredible! It is a heavy coaching culture and you learn so much not only from the management but most importantly from your peers. I never felt like I was the smartest person in the room, and was ALWAYS learning. It's pretty typical in terms of a sales role in regards to the day to day, but it's the approach and type of partnership we offer that truly sets us apart. I did always want to move out of Sales since I had started in it 5 years prior, but had not found the right opportunity. Learning the culture, products, organization and overachieving in my sales role allowed me to create excellent relationships with my manager and upper management, and through networking and with their blessing I was able to secure a role in recruiting, which I absolutely love - it's so fulfilling bringing others into a company I love so much, and promoting equality and inclusive hiring practices along the way! The community of incredible people is truly what makes this such a special place - everyone is always so willing to help here. It is definitely a place where you work hard, but they do a good job of providing breaks/time off to mentally recharge! They are also incredibly supportive of having a family which has made my transition into motherhood so much easier. I can't imagine working anywhere else!wellness reimbursement, free snacks, family planning benefits, job stability, healthcare benefits, Pto, Sto, Vto, Espp, 401k matchingGood sales training providedAt Salesforce you will develop quickly with a great training program for Sales. There isn't much room for quick growth however and many employees with leave to progress at another company and come back in at a higher position which would have taken much longer had they stayed in Salesforce.Salesforce Embodies the Value of TrustTrust is a core value at Salesforce and it drives all of our business and interactions. This culture of trust promotes honest and open feedback and strong business relationships.remote workSome corporate red tapeI love working for salesforce and these are the one of the best 5 years of workI love working for salesforce and these are the one of the best 5 years of work. They are very particular about the work life balance. I love their survey and the way the they act on the survey resultsBest culture there can beI haven’t been really stressed in 7 years of working at Salesforce. We’ve had conflicts and problems and deadlines, sure, but in the end most colleagues are decent human beings with a great sense of humor. The downside is slowness of change - it’s hard to make radical change given the importance of people’s well-beingGreat Company to Work forThey really care about you and don't know of a better group to work for. They really do have a positive culture. I have been places they say that and don't really have one.Innovative and smart peopleYou will brush shoulders with some of the best in industry. Good benefits and compensation plan. Employee friendly. Takes care of life stage needs.. with niche benefits like - fertility treatment over and above normal insuranceIncredible experience, insane work ethicFirst off, salesforce is amazing to work at. Whether you're just getting started or well into your career - you will learn so much and you will get the recognition. But you're expected to be 100% on all the time, no excuses. It gets a little boiler room at times and you have no voiceIncredible company to work for with many opportunities to grow and learn.If you crave a fast-paced environment, a product portfolio that continues to evolve and grow, team selling at it's finest, accountability and a commitment to win, then you will be a great fit at Salesforce. Sales roles are not for the faint of heart and will challenge even the most experienced to up-level their skills.If you're willing to push yourself, the success and career opportunities will be there.Great Culture, Great Product, Great People, Great CompensationWork/Life balance can be a challengeGreat company - maybe getting too bigI've been here a while, have had a great career here. Things are getting complicated. Too many reorgs too often. Difficult to stay prioritized with too many competing and ever changing initiatives. Lots of change in product and engineer leadership lately. A serious changing of the guards happening.Great ethics, benefits, flexibility, compNo funding for anything, do more with less is the mantraAmazing place to work!Have worked at Salesforce for 5 years and have really enjoyed my time thus far! Great company, culture, people and environment. The company really values its employees.wellness benefits, work/ life balance, culture, offices have snacks and drinkspay internal promotes less than external; a lot of internal meetings that consume your daysGreat for working momsI have had two kids while working for Salesforce and the environment for new and expecting parents is unparalleled. Not only do we have amazing benefits but more there is a great sense of community for supporting each other during the good and tough times of being a parent. At Salesforce I always feel like a person first and not just a cog in a big machine. I think this comes directly from the Top.Leadership is totally blind and very political.I was given lots of work on my 2nd day of onboarding with 7 days of delivery time. Then another project with closed timelines and as soon as it was done, they moved me out of the program. I suffered so much mentally after being an over achiever and delivered so much in shortest time.Great culture, products, customers, and C-suite visionGreat culture, products, customers, and C-suite vision. I've worked here for 5+ years and seen the Salesfroce transform into a large-yet-still-innovative company.You can do what you wantFake reviews. Not what is promised. Get ready to drive for nothing and be penalized. High pressure sales with an unknown environment where most people don’t want you there.A Rare blend of Innovation, Corp Culture, Benefits & Work-Life BalanceSalesforce has provided me unparalleled opportunities for Personal & Professional Growth, Career Advancement, Training, & manageable work-life balanceLove SalesforceI started 6 months ago after working at my previous company for 10 years and will never look back! Great culture and leadership genuinely cares about the wellbeing of their employeesI feel valued and love the company's valuesI really like working for a company that has values that I care about (specifically, sustainability and equality).It's great having the resources we need to get our work done - computer hardware and VMs, but also education when we need it, travel when it's needed, and so on.The planning process is generally clear and transparent, which makes it easy to understand what you're working on and how that fits into the overall company strategy.Salesforce has a strong focus on having data that backs up decisions. As a performance engineer, where data is the core of my job, I find this very refreshing.The Salesforce Raleigh office has an amazing culture, Salesforce Raleigh is a place where everyone feels helpful and welcoming.Salesforce makes a lot of effort on ""fun"" activities which just aren't important to me.You can be your authentic self and be appreciated for itAt Salesforce, everyone is valued for their initiative, effort, and contribution, and respected for their diversity. It is really a unique culture with a positive vibe.Bad territory PIPGot PIP at mulesoft. Manager did not help much wuth helping me achieve target. Remote is great, a lot of flexibility. Coworkers were good. Great benefits.Great team cultureGreat workplace culture. All of my coworkers across the organization, even outside of my discipline, are incredibly professional and have always been positive, kind, and supportive. People here really go out of their way to help each other out and create a good team culture where everyone feels heard, respected, and supported.1Excellent company to work withI have a great team which feels like a family. Very cooperative, flexible timings, Good management. Great office locations and spaces. Helps in personal growth with helping company grow.Helps in training skills that I need to master, Cannot complain about anything. Privileged to work in worlds top companiesfamily like people, good skill enhancement, best companyFrequent org changesPull back the veneer and you'll see the ugly truthI worked for Salesforce for about two years. Within that time I noticed a cultural change towards ultra liberal progressivism which was then mainstream within the office and constantly shoved down our throats doing activities or meetings that took away from work time which we would later need to make up by staying late or coming in early. Management is the typical fake friend who only promotes a** kissers. I did learn some useful skills and insights there however they lied about promotion time and would switch around our metrics & compensation more than expected for such an ""amazing"" company. By the end of it all I was so burned out I quit the job and then moved across the country to restart my life. Take with that what you will. I now run my own company successfully in South Florida and regret nothingDecent Pay, Good Benefits, Smart PeopleFakeness Everywhere, Constant Micromanagement, Promotions Based on Brown Nosing or Race, Constant Ultra Liberal PropagandaProgressive Company That's Not Without FlawsI love the fact that Salesforce has fully embraced hybrid work. Still working through the teething pains of project delivery in a hybrid environment, but it's getting better. If you don't want to be in the office 5 days a week, value working for a company that encourages giving back to the community and truly embraces being mindful, then Salesforce is for you.Employee focused, very inclusive environment, progressive on social causesRapid growth, usual struggles with being able to scaleGrateful to be at SalesforceSalesforce is a company that cares about you and about the world. Work-wise, your happiness depends on the team you are on and on your manager, but as things move fast here, you are never stuck in the same situation for too long.An imperfect company that's working hard everyday to get it rightA typical day at work generally calls for problem-solving. The problems are never the same, but most of the time, there is a clear process or framework for the journey from problem to solution.There are tools that will help you set goals, challenge yourself, and navigate your career. The management does send down heavy-handed requirements sometimes, but most of the work is done on teams with clear charters and areas of ownership and those teams are generally able to make their own plans in line with the technical direction of the organization.The company leads with values and integrity. They don't always get it right, but they try every day to improve. When they get it wrong, they learn and adapt.Used to be the industry standard, but no moreI came to Salesforce because of their stellar reputation as being a company full or intelligent, hard working, community focused people. Over the years, the company's values, commitment to community as well as its employees' well being and work life balance has deteriorated and it's now all talk and no action. Executive leadership is non-transparent and not trust worthy. Unless you are part of the inner circle, you are left out when it comes to promotions, raises and bonuses. It's a shame to see such a great company come crashing down.Flexible work locationOver-worked, under-paid, impossible to get promoted, too much backstabbing and politicking.A company with clear values that even my family appreciatesI have an intense job in a dynamic environment. Executive leadership is incredibly talented and committed. This is a company where you feel respected and valued.Best company I've ever worked for; they truly value their employeesSalesforce values it's employees, and they prove it with their generous pay and benefits. They also provide floating holidays, ""wellness"" days throughout the year (averaging 1 per month) since the pandemic. They really care about their employees' mental health and work/life balance.When in the office, there is free food & beverages including a starbucks-like cafe, alternative spaces to work, and private rooms for meetings and phone calls.None, this is a great company and everyone feels privileged to work there.Salesforce lacks equality and pays less than standardTypical day at work is fine - little micromanagement and my co-workers are friendly. Management is really young here, and our team has two brand new managers. It really shows by how they've hired our team; nothing about our team is equal right now; pay, level, nothing. It's very up in the air and feels like a popularity contest to say the least. Work/life balance would be fine, but it's really not that great when they keep tacking on additional job duties and responsibilities but not offering raises or promotions. Across the board we have severe burnout, and it was even noted in the annual employee survey. It's nice to have a day off for wellness, and $100 stipend for the gym.....but where does that really get you when your pay sucks and management doesn't do anything to fix the problems of inequality among team members. It baffles me still that trust/equality our part of our top core values. I don't trust salesforce anymore because they just tell you what they want you to hear, but don't follow through on promises.Great people great benefitsFun place to wor with some truly incredible people. Some managers over the years have been exceptional, some have been darn right horrid. Many opportunities to network, learn and develop and move around. Great CEO and positive environment in most part.Excellent company outwardly exposureMid Management -equality fairness is low, opportunities to offer for promotion is low. Baises on Age and race prevalent.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Pleasantly surprised with how agile Salesforce is given its size. Salesforce makes a strong effort to empower and make individuals heard in the organization. Great leadership with a vision to make the world better through technology.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being a product specialist, you have very little downtime. I am always on meetings (often back to back) throughout an entire day with customers or needing to work on other initiatives. Pivoting between different business verticals is challenging, stressful, but also fun.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great. While every company posts about initiatives ""they are doing"" or ""how much they care"", Salesforce actually commits to making the environment better for it's employees regardless of background/beliefs/orientation etc. From a business perspective, it's very fast paced.Smart people and great benefits, burnout is realThis is the longest job I’ve held in my nearly 20 year career for a reason. People are generally smart and hard working, so you’re not dealing with laziness and apathy. But the overachiever mentality also makes people work themselves to the ground, and expectations are high. The company tries to counter that with unlimited PTO, generous leave, mental health and wellness benefits, volunteer opportunities, and equality groups (ERGs), but there’s no mistaking that there is burnout, particularly since the pandemic. Culture is also dependent on your team. I’ve experienced amazing culture, and lackluster culture, but honestly the overall flexibility in work-styles (still able to be remote since the pandemic) and benefits are what ultimately have kept me from joining another company. The constant re-orgs and fire drills in doing things on a crunched timeline for leadership are also tiring. It’s definitely lost most of its scrappy and anything resembling a startup culture, but again if you’re looking for a solid company with overall good culture and job security this is really a great place to be. They still need to work on diversity and transparent and less biased promotions, particularly moving up the ranks and in executive leadership. And (as a white woman), I don’t mean more white women…Good productPeople know usLots of advancement OppRemote work is goodManagers can have tough expectationsI like but don’t love my jobTry it out for yourself.Good optionsShort breaksIt's been a great ride!I'm what Salesforce calls a Boomerang. I worked here for two years in 2013-14 that didn't go too well. I returned in 2019 and have been very pleased to see how Salesforce has addressed many of the challenges I had during my first tenure. I am challenged daily, both internally and by my customers. Internally, Salesforce can be a difficult place to navigate. Very virtual and sometimes hard to network. However, we are all on the same team, and I eventually get what I need. My customers expect excellence from me and the company. They expect us to live by our #1 core value, TRUST. I do my best to meet their high expectations and it has led to fantastic, long-term relationships. Salesforce does what it says it will do and survives on its values. This is a great place to work.Great Company to work forThe pressure to close is immense but the payoff is more than fair. Some of the support teams lack experience but if you put in the work you will be rewardedNot a good place to be anymore.Stressful, disjointed, high turnover, backstabbing, toxicity. Not a good place to be. Leadership is stressed and the priorities shift constantly. Grew too big too fast maybe.Cool but challengingSalesforce is a pretty cool place to work. My team is full of hard workers. My manager is supportive.Con - Your value is determined by whether or not you hit your quarterly/yearly numbers. Sometimes, it can get a bit overwhelming to keep hitting your goals.Remote working options; benefitsDemanding goals; limited supported depending on your teamPrepare to be stressedExtremely stressful work environment, vague direction, hope to work you to death and get away with it because they’re “Salesforce”.Great in office snacks thoughBad territory PIPGot PIP at mulesoft. Manager did not help much wuth helping me achieve target. Remote is great, a lot of flexibility. Coworkers were good. Great benefits.Great place for growthI feel supported by my manager to succeed in my role and receive feedback on my growth areas. The work-life balance is great and I love the people I work withStrong company values that come through in the day to day. As an acquired company, the change is constant.I came into Saleforce via acquisition. Generally, I love the Salesforce values, leadership, and accountability to practicing what we preach. Benefits are good (comparative to what we had before - some are better than others). As an acquisition, there was a lot of enthusiasm at the onset of bringing us onboard, but it tapered off a bit and the constant has been change that comes with big impacts. Likely the nature of an acquisition and I generally like working at this company but it's been a pretty big challenge...not always in a good way.Awesome place to work! great benefit and culture. Cutting edge technology and place to learn and experience and learn new thingsAt Salesforce you are building your career and it's not a ""job"" and ""paycheck"" ! Awesome place to work! great benefit and culture. Cutting edge technology and place to learn and experience and learn new thingsIf you find the right one, your leader will support you 100%Salesforce has changed my life for the better. I feel very fortunate to work here. After working at the company, I switched roles and departments and I'm even happier than I was originally! IMO, Salesforce support cannot be matched.Great Company and Great CultureGreat Company culture where you feel included and valued from Hire to retire. Vast area of opportunity to grow with technology or as a peoples leader. Excellent work life balance and Global working culture. You will find many in KoA club(Completed 10 yrs) which inspire others.Work life balance, Great inclusive culture, Trust & Transparency in Management HierarchyCompensations need to be revised with current Market mostly for existing employees vs new hires, Stock Options allocation and refresh should be revisitedGreat Company with great culture and benefitsI love Salesforce. I get unlimited PTO, I have room to learn and grow, and don't feel stressed. This company is overall great. It's allowing me to really advance in my career and managers want to help just as much!Benefits, Culture, GrowthHonest and transparent leadershipThe leadership is always clear about what is happening inside the company and communicates their decisions.On my team, I feel supported to task risks and given the guidance I need to succeed.Great culture, strong products, excellent career prospectsI have always preferred small companies. I thought in large companies it becomes all about politics and not competence. Salesforce is definitely the exception to the rule. Everyone I worked with - and I've worked with many different teams over my 10-year tenure - was smart, hard-working and considerate. I still recall one meeting where one colleague was rude to another because it was so unusual, and that rude person was soon unemployed. There are so many products and opportunities that the possibilities for advancement and learning new skills are virtually unlimited. Salesforce is a company with principles and values. One of the most important for me was the 1-1-1 model (1% of product, equity and hours are support charitable endeavors). It has many programs, but the most significant for me were matching gifts and 56 hours of paid time off to volunteer. They support diversity and LGBTQ+ rights. This is a company that supported remote work before it became mandatory, and stepped it up during COVID with things like a stipend to enhance your home workspace and daily wellness classes. The support for parents is the best I've ever heard of, including support for adoption, invitro, etc., and paid paternal leave. I am proud to be a former Salesforce employee and feel it is a shining example of how to create a vibrant, helpful, kind culture.Uplifting work enviornmentAn excellent work culture that is centered around supporting one another and embracing diversity. If you are ever in doubt, there will always be someone you can turn to for help and answer questions.Overall great workplace actively trying to improveI really enjoy working at Salesforce. I was acquired in via another company and was initially skeptical. Over the last 6 years I've become such a cheerleader for this company! And I didn't expect that.I am consistently presented with opportunities to learn and grow in my career, and encouraged to explore skills both within and outside of my core capabilities/responsibilities.My team is great to work with and I feel like my manager is actively invested in my growth and wellbeing. She is one of the core reasons why I am proud to work here and why I don't want to leave.The hardest part of my job is deciding how much time and energy I want to put into advancing up the ladder. It's kind of nice because if a lot of stuff is going on in my personal life I feel like I can de-prioritize it, but if I really want to get promoted then I need to be actively building a case to do so.Salesforce is committed to employees as stakeholders and walks the walk.Five years at Salesforce have been a continuos learnng experience with good growth opportunities. Managers are incented and generally very good at collaborating with and assisting employees reach corporate and individual goals. Better than other companies I have worked with over the years.Working at SalesforceWith more than 20 years of experience, this is easily the best work environment I've ever been part of: safe, non judgmental and supportive. Salesforce's culture promotes learning, team work, work/life balance while modeling great business and human values.Ok companyThe pros out way the cons but definitely a great place to work for motivated people that are extroverted and love to communicate because there’s an over communication issue at salesforceGreatI loved it I made a lot of new professional connections during the 6 months I was there. I was also able to gain as much learning experience as possibleFun workplaceNot good enough benefits. But the pay and work culture are amazing. Additionally they do some terrific charity work. Employees are given volunteer time offGreat culture.Great culture, great managers, room for self development, great DE&I.Decent amount of openings to transition lower level roles to higher roles, so there could be more opps in that respect.Great culture + worklife balanceDoesn't pay as much as FAANGGood citizenship at corporate level, but the company is still maturing internallyThe citizenship aspect of the company, contributing to society is one of the best.In terms of work environment, the company is still developing, it does not yet have the processes and structure to match its market presence. It is very top down driven and the majority of folks just do as they are told. One can have a lot of impact based on individual work.There is a bit of title inflation compared with other companies (for example at the VP level).There is a lot of respect for personal time, so from that angle it is a more relaxed and respectful work environment than other companies (AMZN, MSFT, etc)great offices and work from home policies, philanthropy, ability to do great workdo as you are told approach even at VP levels, processes/metric rigor/data driven lags compared to the size and impact of the companyCompany Values & Fast PaceSalesforce is always doing 'the right thing' by its customers, employees, and the world in general. You will always be learning and growing at Salesforce. The pace of innovation is fast, so at times it is hard to keep up!If you're looking for a company that's steeped in cutting-edge tech but also has decent work-life balance, Salesforce is a great place to work.I've worked for Salesforce for over two years now in the same position. I started before the pandemic and from day one felt connected to the work culture here. I'm always learning as I work.In my org, work-life balance is highly encouraged and with the integration of Slack, it's easy to step away from the desk for a few.The pay is pretty high for my non-technical role. I'd only ever consider leaving this company for astronomical pay at a FAANG company.great benefits, good pay, great work-life balance, cultural communitiesCan't take on outside workSalesforce has great products, strong leadership, a collaborative and supportive culture, and truly cares about its customers and people.Salesforce has been a great place to work and grow a career. Firstly - we have great products. I help our customers adopt these products and I have very interesting conversations with our customer leadership who are driving business value on our platform. Secondly - we have great leadership and a culture of leading courageously. I am really inspired by both my direct managers and executive leadership - who care about the people and making it a great place to work. The caliber of people I work with is high, and although everyone is high-achieving they also stay supportive and collaborative, and everyone's successes are genuinely celebrated. We invest a lot in our customers and in our people - and it shows. It's a great size of company to work for: large with some structure but not impossible to navigate. Promotion/ advancement may be easier or more difficult depending on the growth of the group, but I have appreciated all the learning and growth opportunities. It's great to learn about how our products are evolving and how they are getting used by our customers to do innovative and impactful things. Lastly - as a working mom I don't think I could find better balance and support anywhere else. The hours are manageable, I have a lot of support from leadership, and I got promoted twice - both times right around my 6 month long maternity leave - a sign they were investing in me and made me really enthusiastic to come back.Great WFH policies, beautiful offices with free barista bar, snacks. Great maternity and paternity leave programs, great training for leaders and people managers.Depending on group, advancement can take longer."
College Fresh Inc,"Unique chef opportunityChronically understaffed, partially because of pandemic, and partly deliberate. The company uses travelling chefs when necessary, but still many house do not have assistants.Professional companyToo many chiefs.2Family Business with a focus on supportI've been with the company for over three years now. Seeing our leadership navigate the challenges of the pandemic while focusing on supporting our teams through that challenging time was impressive. I've been allowed the chance to work past mistakes and learn as I go in certain areas. Communication is a priority and it always feels like everything is a conversation and you are being heard.Understanding and communication from my supervisors.Certain times of the year can be stressful, that's unavoidable in our industry though.Internal advancement, fair compensationCollege Fresh has been an excellent company to work for to this point. Compensation and benefits package is much better than industry standard, and advancement within the company feels extremely possible.Fun work place with pingGood job with a decent company. You get to be creative and there's usually no moron looking over your shoulder. The college kids are fun and you get more vacation than you'll find anywhere else. Also, a decent support system from upper management that seem human.Business going downhillEvery since one of the partners retured the company hasn't been the same, you can definitely tell the people running the company have never done what they ask of their employees since my staff of 4 to 6 people to cater to 5 properties daily was cut down to 1 to 2 people. Was a great company a few years ago unfortunately it is not anymore that's why I left before it got even worse.Ability to write fun menus weekly.Bosses out of touch with what they expect of you.Job Not worth itThe company lies to you to get you to start work with paid time off and sick days and vacation pay and they only give you sick time as a chef assistant and NO vacation or Paid time off after telling you that you're going too they basically lay you off for all holidays without pay they give you a paper for unemployment which does not cover anything when you have a family and bills and rent and I also found out from management that I wasn't eligible for rehire because I called out the company in my resignation letter because the company doesn't know how to make sure the employees are taking care of.Free foodThe whole job is a conThere’s just too many awful things to even startJust don’t. It’s really not worth it. They will over work you and if you’re female you don’t matter. You can’t actually progress unless it’s convenient for them and you have to deal with privileged people demanding things from you that aren’t even your responsibility.Laid back Workplace has it's ups and downsVery welcoming company that rewards hard work and dedication. Can be stressful but as long as you're a team player it can be a fun rewarding experience. Has been hurt by workers not showing up or making clients uncomfortable and management can at times be a little unorganized. But overall a decent company to work for.extreamly ego drivennot at all pleased to much demand to high standards little support i was let go for some thing i did not do no compashion for employees i would not recondmend working theirHorrible Company do not work for them.CollegeFresh is a terrible company that does not care about its employees. They make promises then go back on all of them. I was a dishwasher but had friends ""higher up"" and they were worked to death. This company does not promote work-life balance. They will work you until you die and then replace you immediately and have no remorse. They send out emails from a CEO, who's never worked in a kitchen, to tell you how great you are doing but won't give you a pay raise to remain competitive. They expect people to work 80 hours a week for nothing and then get mad when people leave. Do not work for this company.You can eat leftovers that the ""clients"" don't eat.EverythingIt was okayOkay job for college students. Seasonal the pay is low but its easy work. They have a hard time keeping employees so you may be forced to fill in at other houses. It is an okay job.A sense of freedom the students you work for are really pleasantFinacial stress over school breaksScope of work exceeds pay rateClients very appreciative, management not so much. Advancement opportunities practically nonexistent. Raises minimal if at all. Management interested only in client satisfaction. Long hours with stranglehold on labor budget. Weekends and holidays off are a plus. Management expects you to handle accounts when out sick/family leave without compensation. Opportunities for advancement a selling point for potential employees , I have yet to see any.Free lunch, creative freedom, weekends and holidays off.Low pay, high demands, administrative duties off the clock to meet labor budget. No incentives. Sick/family leave a joke.If you like summers and Christmas off, this is the place for you!The best job I’ve had in my life, ever! You work Monday to Friday office hours, once or twice a semester you will be asked, and you can decline, to work a special event on a weekend day. Paid federal holidays, benefits.Get in on the action!Toxic Corporate CultureGreat job with awful management.Get used to being told ""I don't know what to tell you.""Chronic and intentional under staffing.Corporate managers have far too much leeway to go outside of company policies.Best company to work for!College Fresh has been nothing but good to me the entire time I have worked for them! I love that they offer an amazing work/life balance! Makes me feel good that I work for a company that cares about me!Good for self motivated individualsYou are on your own for the most part. Keep the clients happy and hit you financial budget, and you will be successful. Best for self motivated people. Allows for creating fun and exciting new things. You create the atmosphere. If you dont want to expand you skills and abilities, don't bother. Its not for someone who just wants to punch a time clock.Great place to work during the school yearIt’s a great job with no later hours and weekends and holidays off. Biggest downfall is if the college isn’t in session you are put on furlough and have to go on unemployment. In general I’d recommend this company as a decent place to work.No work during summersProductive and Fun workplace with an excellent staffCollege Fresh is the first company where immediately you feel welcomed and at home. Managers and staff are willing to help any way possible and are so understanding. This is a great company if looking for advancement, great pay and benefits.Employees are not complacent in daily work duties.A lot of walking in the Alabama summer heat but the fresh air is welcomed.Lies, Lies, and more Lies!!!!This company promised good raises, which is only pennies and dimes. If a family member dies you have to use your sick days (which they give you only 3) no bereavement pay!! They will use their best chefs and definitely not give them a good raise and make promises like you can advance within the company, but yet if your campus already has a regional and campus manager, then there is nowhere you can go within the company. This company makes alot of money by over charging their clients and giving their employees crumby pay!! This company is based off lies to its clients and employees.Free meals, no weekends or major holidays!!!Not paid for holidays, summer break or even bereavement pay. No good raises, no advancement within the company for growthCollege Fresh is a great employer.College Fresh is a great company to work for as they care about each employee. They make sure to provide great work-life balance for each employee. At College Fresh, they also strive to be communicative and let you know in advance about any changes within the company.Management is a nightmare!!!While working the house I worked at could not keep employees due to poor management from regional and campus managers lack of skill and style. Over just the fall semester we were on our third head chef and second assistant chef. No flexibility in scheduling shifts. No home and work balance for assistant chef's whatsoever.Meals per dayPoor management and leadershipUnique chef opportunityChronically understaffed, partially because of pandemic, and partly deliberate.

Upper management is in Devonshire Illinois, so when you work in any other state but Illinois, it is very difficult to talk with management.Creative freedomNo management supportsome days are better than otherswhen i first started working for the company i learned alot from the chef. Now they hire chefs that have no clue of how to cook.Some of the chefs don't care about presentation of their food.free meal, healthcare benefitsAtmosphereI started out as a Chef Assistant 3 years and now I'm a Head Chef. Hard work and consistency is noticed here. The down time during the summer is a bummer, but I love working herekitchen assistant... decent jobProbably one of the easiest jobs at the company- very flexible hours since there are many different meal services. HR can be hard to get a hold of, but everything else has gone pretty smoothly during my time thereOkayThe job was OK the first couple of days does Chef seem like she was a good leader, although her first assistant called out for three days straight, we maintained and completed artists together even got a couple chances to throw in a few of my own recipes. I feel that they ask a lot of dishes for assistance for what they pay not only was I asked to bake for my sorority house but also another Chef sorority‘s house, my Chef is not a woman of her word has awesome recipes but her leader ship skills really suck. She came in at eight yeah the guy came in at night and they only had to do chicken noodle soup and grilled cheese it’s like they were waiting for me to come in at 10:30 to do their job and I was very dissatisfied by that her whole demeanor and attitude changed once her chef assistant got there and I recommend that she has a crew of guys because any female that works there is going to have an issue with herYou get to be creative$14, lack of leader ship, And respect for others methodsA great place to work as a Chef. Good benefits and work hours.Cooking for a set group of college students with a set weekly schedule. Manage food budgets, team staff, menus and meal preparations. Clients are very thankful and nice. Benefits are rare to find in the food industry.Free meals, Pto, Health Insurence, Dental Insurence, 401Klearned a lotThis company taught me a lot, I am very grateful for the people I met during my time here. They had a lot of properties to work at and many different chefs to work under from many different backgrounds and experience. Working to help feed the students was very fulfilling and gave me a sense of belonging to a community.My Dream Job!This family owned company is exactly what I was looking for. They value me as an employee and continuously assists me in my career growth. Their training is great and I am encouraged to be open/honest about where I need to improve, and they are happy to help. Customer service is the heart of this company which shines through both internally and externally. The benefits are great and they emphasize the importance of a work-life balance. Love College Fresh!Great companyCollege Fresh is a professional food service provider, whom excels at maintaining above average satisfaction with their contracted employers and staff.Set work scheduleNoneWork follows University schedule therefore no holidays, weekends, and Summer off.Usual schedule Monday through Friday all dependent on the sorority or fraternity contract. Challenging in that you are feeding the same people daily so the menu must be varied weekly. Nice balance of autonomy and support.Schedule, benefitsCommunication challengesManagement stinksThey are poorly managed if the house says something about you they fire you without even asking you if its true this is not a good working environmentLearned a lot from the multiple chefs with whom I worked.In the short time I worked with College Fresh I worked with five chefs. I learned something from each chef, but it was difficult b/c each chef has there own preferences and ways of doing things.Not much Personal LifeThis job takes practically your whole day. Some work 7 am to 2:30 pm. Others like me work 10 or 9 am to 7 pm. That is practically your whole day. Fridays at some places is the on day during the week you may have time leaving after lunch around 2 pm. This job says you only work Monday through Friday but if the mess up a contract you may have to work Monday through Friday and Sunday for about 4 hours. I'm not sure but they may try to keep it that way. Look out for that and if hired and this happens try to remind them what you were hired on for and agreed to. The job environment can vary depending on the house you get and crew or Chef you are with. The job pays nice and isn't too bad but you never know really.You’re held responsible for your own actions. You can make it a positive experience if you have the right frame of mind.I enjoy the chef’s job because I have only myself to hold responsible for the tasks the company requires. Also, no one can sabotage me but me.I like making my own fate.I also enjoy the students I cook for who are usually always grateful for everything they are served and truly enjoy it or are honest about it if they don’t.Great place to workLiterally the best chef owned company you can work for. Paid breaks during the school year, 75% paid health insurance, two days off a week and endless resources. Of course some days are harder than others but the challenge is welcomed. You have to prioritize your time, work within a budget and manage a few other people but its decent work for what is available in college townsFun Workplace, good hoursCollege Fresh is a wonderful company to work for. The benefits are good and the hours are nice. It's hard to find a Monday-Friday kitchen position, so this one is a steal! If I didn't have other personal reasons, I definitely would have stayed with them.Not impressedCollege fresh have traveling chef and with no management knowledge.I meet 3 Traveling chef at this company and look like this people never have any dietary or allergies food training, they do the best they can at their own knowledge.one of them toll me that egg is a diary product.I argued with him about it until I toll him to google it I toll him that chicken doesn’t produce milkand heFlexible, fun work place with a family/friendly, supportive environmentI have worked with College Fresh for a year and feel as though I was incredibly lucky to find this company. They are a family owned business and have always made me feel welcome and appreciated for the work I do with them. If I request any training, they don't hesitate to help. If I ever have any questions or need assistance with anything, they don't hesitate to help however they can. College Fresh is a rapidly growing company; therefore, they have numerous ways to go for growth and promotions. I am allowed a flexible schedule, wonderful benefits, and never feel like I am going to ""work"". I truly enjoy spending my days with my team. I would highly recommend employment with College Fresh.Unique chef opportunityChronically understaffed, partially because of pandemic, and partly deliberate. The company uses travelling chefs when necessary, but still many house do not have assistants.Professional companyToo many chiefs.2Family-oriented, opportunity for advancement and valued at work!I've been with the company for 4 years and have had the opportunity to learn, grow and advance professionally and personally. The owners take pride in getting to know the clients and employees all across the country. I look forward to working in an environment where I feel my ideas are heard and my work and experience is valued. I recommend this company to anyone looking to make a ""fresh"" start!1Everyday is a New AdventureI started as a Chef at College Fresh and within a year was promoted to the Regional Manager. My job has been fun, exciting, and a learning adventure. Any time that I had a stressful moment I have had support. It is a family-owned company which is awesome because they understand that family comes first. The owners are super nice and are accessible if you ever need them or have questions. Our whole structure of the company works and you have support from everywhere. My position is a very fast pace on the go position, but it also allows me to cook with my chefs, talk one on with our clients ( not just about business stuff), and be flexible with my time. You have to love and have passion for what you do and this company allows you to do that rather you are a Chef Assistant, Chef, dishwasher, or Regional Manager!1Run away, far and fastEverything revolves around an impossible budget. Supervisors are paid a percentage of budget numbers. However, it is not possible to feed folks on less than what food stamp recipients get.Sorority ladies are very appreciative.They will NOT supply you with the equipment you need to do your job .Horrible alcoholic manager/boss.My direct supervisor was an obvious alcoholic. Every day he would got to his ""office"" around 2 or 3 and spend the rest of the day on his computer in a bar down the street. Very uncomfortable. The job itself sucks unless you live very close by as you work from 8am till at least 8pmNoneToo many to listTerrible place to work!Terrible place to work! Major OSHA violations including broken lights and equipment. Not allowed to use earned sick pay. Major gaps in available work. Not paid for fall break, Christmas(3 weeks), spring break and summer break(3 months. Very understaffed and management and upper management did nothing to fix this problem. No opportunity for advancement or a raise. Overall terrible experience!I love it!I started in April of 2019 directly after Spring Break. They had to replace the then chef due to inconsistencies and not performing to company standards. I love it here! I work 10-12 hour days. I have a house boy to help do dishes periodically but don't need an assistant. I have a house of 40 ladies. I create and write menus. The girls enjoy giving you their requests. I find my budget healthy enough to do what I want. Management does not interfere with me at all. They call when they need to inform me of something and respond to me when I need something from them. During the week it's just me and the ladies. The House Director and I get along very well. I have no complaints about this company. Just do your job and it's awesome! The time off is amazing. You get 160 hours of pto to use in the summer. You don't get paid on breaks, so you need to be aware of that. I haven't been here a year yet so I can't speak to raises... but will be asking for one at my year benchmark. You are only paid what you can negotiate.Wonderful Management, Great CompanyCollege Fresh is a great place to work. Management is kind, respectful and accommodating to employees.The entire operation is a well-oiled machine and all employees strive to ensure clients are being heard, acknowledged and their needs met. The tagline 'At Your Service' is truly ingrained in College Fresh's corporate culture. It is exciting to work for a company that is honest, credible and values their employees and cares deeply for their clients.Good for retireesIf you're done with the chef life in restaurants and bars, this is a good fit. The pace is good for a 9-5 kind of life. It gives a lot of time for families and recreational activities. However, politics of individual houses and contracts make this unappealing.moneyPoliticsNot worth your time.Not even worth explaining. Stay away . Bad people in a worst workplace when it s supposed to be an easy job. Backstabbing for no reason . No care for the students while presenting the opposite. All fake . Managements present only for disciplinary actions usually take money back from you for stupid reasons. Unsafe and insecure chefs who will do anything immoral to keep their jobs because they can t make it elsewhere. Just terrible.None benefits givenGreat job for career minded ChefsCurrently work with College Fresh and Love it. You will always have challenges and issues with ANY job as a chef. Not a complicated endeavor. Just make awesome food, communicate with the people around you, and rise to the task at hand. Folks whining about having to work 7 - 7 when someone quits need re-evaluate their job title. If you're the head chef you are responsible for the full functionality of the food service for your account. You have to own that! All you have to do is be the boss they hired you to be and you will love your job. Great time off! Great schedule. Getting a solid staff put together takes some time, but that's with any kitchen.productiveit was ok, could have had less drama. In the beginning all of my coworkers were really cool, however as time went on, people started to change and start to slack off at work, and I would end up picking up after everyone else.A great company to work for.I love working for College Fresh. As a chef I love the schedule, benefits, and time off. I have some freedom to make a menu that pleases the clients, but still challenges my skills as a chef.Great jobI loved the job. They were fair and worked with you. The only problem I had was with the head chefs at times. Other than that things were smooth sailing.Works with youHead chefs suck sometimesHorribleNot at all what they advertise to be they claim to be family oriented and promise work/home life balance be they give you the lowest budget in the Greek service field to work with and expect you to work miraclesNoneHorrible!!Poor ManagementTalk Badly About Other ChefsThey Wait 2 To 3 Weeks Before School Starts Back To Tell You If You Have a Job Or NotDuring The Interview I Was Told That I Was Getting Paid During The Summer Never Saw a CheckNo Advancement OpportunitiesLow Pay And They Work You Like a DogThey Don’t Appreciate Good Hard Working EmployeesGreat Place to workAwesome Company to work you have room to grow and some unbelievable time off also if you wanted to travel and go to different places meeting different people and making great food it's an awesome Place College Fresh the best.Don’t waste your timeIt’s a family owned company that only cares about itself. They turn employees against each other and end up firing everyone. You’re not acknowledged or even noticed unless you make a mistake then they find a way to fire you. Corporate level management is disorganized without knowledge of what’s truly going on. Some campus managers and regional managers are nice and work with their employees. But most of the time you’re on your own to figure it or get fired.Sorority was cool.The family owned company sucked. They are liars and a crooked company to work for. They allow management to turn employees against each other. They also create bad relationships between chef and house mom. If you have time to waste then this is the job.Bad managementThey are terribly unorganized. Poor leadership, they don’t know how to deal with problems that accure at the workplace. They also have a hard time hiring employees. I was shtetl chef and when my assistant quit they could not replace her and I worked from7am to 7 pm for 4 straight monthsYou'll do a great job. While being taken advantage of.This company will make any promise or claim to get you hired. I agreed to accept the job. With the understanding of a current crew in place. No crew for weeks to help, manager only helped when threaten to quit. At interview told 160 hours pto. While on winter break. I was emailed stating pto was adjusted to 120 hours. Leaving the final week of break unpaid. Filed for unemployment, they fought that also. A company that doesn't care about it's workforce or how much you helped them recover a troubled account. Don't work for this companyTime off for holidaysWill not support your quality of life."
Leidos,"Great company to work forLeidos is a great company to work for. My supervisor always kept in contact with me and provided prompt feedback for evaluation reviews.

I have enjoyed working for them.Impactful workGreat leadership that cares about employee satisfaction, good pay, a lot of learning opportunities and chances to move around within the company, overall great companyLarge contractor offers variety, flexibility, growth opportunities, and resources, but compensation on the low side and program management variesWorking for a contractor comes with pros and cons. On the up side, there are opportunities for a wide variety of work, and management does a good job of shifting people around when work slows down to keep people billable. Staying billable and time tracking can be stressful at times, but in my experience it hasn't been too bad - the company is pulling in large amounts of work and as long as there aren't project overruns or lots of unbillable time, it's no problemo.As a large company with many divisions and projects, there are opportunities to shift around internally. The quality of program management varies quite widely, with some having very well-established procedures while others are somewhat less well-ordered, but it's not been difficult in my experience to navigate away from programs I didn't care for and more towards those that interest me.Leidos has really embraced work from home and flexibility generally - as long as work gets done on time and to an acceptable standard, they don't care all that much how it gets done. I certainly haven't ever felt micromanaged. In fact, sometimes it feels like there can be too little direction from management.Compensation starts out relatively low compared to industry competitors, and benefits are nothing special, although not terrible either. That said, there are certainly opportunities for growth and the company provides plenty of resources and support for continued education and professional development. The culture is definitely one of the biggest pluses, as most everybody I've interacted with from high-level managers to myCorporately, pretty good, but program management is cluelessGood benefits (high-deductible health insurance), ""green,"" pretty enlightened at corporate level. Program management hurts staff with absurd expectations and customer promises with 0 understanding of processes and actual work. Long-time employees are leaving in drives. No opportunity for advancement; hiring only junior people. South Asians have advantages from cronyism.Best for retired Military!If you are retiring and looking for low stress with great benefits then this is the place.

The contract I worked on, my supervisor was not even working on the same base as me so I didn't really feel connected to the company. It was also disappointing that when our contract changed everyone who had the exact same job title got paid way more than I did even though I was the only person on the team with actual experience with the system we were working on.Easy job, decent 401khigh deductible healthcare, unequal pay, no clear way of moving upGood Job After GraduationI learned a lot while working at Leidos.

Training was well thought out and planned. The compensation was very good and everyone is generally helpful!Poor managementSelf serving management causes issues with employees. They’ve been promoted or moved to other locations instead of fired. Use to be. Great place to work.Good work/life balanceManagementWould recommend other companies firstMediocre pay and benefits - especially PTO. Mid year performance raises were cancelled back to back years. Globo-gym level of corporate emails. The pathway for growth is an absolute joke considering the company has such a foot hold in engineering and aviation, there is no way to transfer skill sets within the company.Giant Defense Contractor that leads the industry in many ways--but is bureaucratic and PC culture focusedHuge defense contractor with industry leading benefits--does not bid on lowest cost contracts. Employers are generally highly capable and professional in conduct and presentation. As to professional development, it's among the best. However, perhaps given its size, it is bureaucratic overall--in some instances moving even slower than the federal government clients its serves. Also, the company is pushing the ""woke"" ESG culture which is a sad thing to watch.

My department didn’t have much room to move up and pay is a bit lower then it should be but overall not bad.MflcLeidos does not pay their MFLCs. They have to constantly email various people to receive entire pay. The excuse is there’s not enough employees to process your pay. It’s been a year.Work at Leidos, one of our nation's primary defense contractorsI worked as a program finance analyst intern at Leidos this summer for approximately 2 months as part of the company's summer program for high-school undergraduates. We were divided up into different groups and assigned to individual managers, who were responsible for our work. My own work happened to be somewhat disorganized due to some mishaps, but overall my experience was positive. That being said, none of the work was particularly difficult.Overall okay but has plenty of room for improvementIt was hard to move laterally within the company. Recruiters failed on many levels.for my current position we really didn't have the software and tools we needed to do the job. Benefits were great raises weren't so great.Micromanage not flexible at allI started out being excited about working with this company but now not so much. I wouldn’t refer anyone to work at this company. All I can say good is I have a job. I thought this would be a stand up company to work for but I was wrong. Not very excited or enthused like I was when I first started.Off on holidays with payNot flexible with my outside lifeGood stepping stone or end company to be withThis company is good but benefits are what it comes down to. Great staff leadership, on board is a little rough.Pro:Pay is highMedical is goodDental is goodVision is goodCoworkers are good and team leads all have been goodConsNo sick leave and give you little vacation if your earlier in your career. Work life balance will suffer from this as you may feel more burnt out from not having enough time off.Switching between projects can be rough to little to no help on staying up for the new onThe company restrictions on software make it hard to do your job sometimes.There is no such thing as pay increases, flat 3% every year no matter how good or badHere for a stepping stone in your career and if it's your last you should be fine but if your just starting out or half way though you'll need to find some other job to get paid what your worth.Lots of opportunities, good company cultureI worked on several different contracts over the years. Your experience really depends on what contract you work on and who runs it.Average benefits and pay.The main problems I saw were mismanagement at the program level on a lot of contracts and in various divisions. However, I blame a lot of that on the way government contracts are handled by the government, giving 3-5 year contracts. Just enough time for groups to get good at the job, but then awarding that follow on to a different company.I believe Leidos as a company puts a lot of effort into being a great company to work for and treats its employees as well as it can for such a large company.Promises made at time of hire not keptLeidos promotes incompetent team leads whom have no ability to positively manage people. Terrible pay and forced unpaid time off. The need is great and job can be draining with no mental health support for providers.Unclear job stabilityLeidos has been the single handed best place to work since separating from the military. They have a great structure in place for pay transparency by pay band, as well as a transparent job progression track. Leidos pays well and fairly per market value. I have felt they only taking on quality work in a contracting capacity and can offer many educational and certification possibilities. The only reason i left the company was for guaranteed job security which I could not find in either or the projects i supported. Leaving was very difficult. If i could have known that i would have had a job for the next 10 years, i would never have left the company at all. It is the nature of contracting and that is a risk we all take when we work in this kind of world. Job progression and benefits don’t mean anything if you don’t have a job. I never Felt like i was ever certain of the period of performance and until i became management, it was never told to me directly without probing. This could be project dependent though … that is my only critique of the company. They do make efforts to place you in the company if you lose the work but it isn’t always a guarantee, i personally just couldn’t take that chance anymore.Great support for staffWonderful job I worked part time for the main office in DC. Great training and nice team members. Plus a beautiful office right by the Capitol. I would recommend this company to all.Problematic ManagementI have been with the company multiple years and worked multiple programs. Turnover on the programs I worked was very high. The flexibly to work remote is the main reason I stayed. Overall management across programs is poorly organized and many times incompetent. There was no training, no guidance, no support. On the flip side of the coin, I was able to exploit the negligent management by taking on more than I was supposed to be doing and I developed skills that allowed me to upgrade my title and pay so that I can leave.I am very happy with my job at LeidosI do feel a sense of belonging and feel that the work culture is very good. I am in a fully remote position and find the pay is more than other companies offer remote employess for the same kind of work. I am able to save money on my health insurance by participating in a HSA. I find that I am learning more and more and not having to ask to be promoted. I am also able to work OT which is important to me financially. I have zero complaints!Good Govt Contracting JobDecent company. Overall not many complaints. I had a great team and local manager. Not much interaction with corporate, though. I really enjoyed my time working thereWork environmentTrainingIT Sweatshop in BlacksburgThere is NO WAY I would recommend working here. Do some homework, look at how many service desk managers let alone employees have left this place over the last 5 years. They adopt an ""assembly line"" approach to IT Support. You really don't want to work here. The phone's never stop ringing, literally. Barely enough time to finish up your ticket notes. Lack of guidance on how to perform certain tasks, knowledge base articles that are inaccurate , and a real sweatshop. You can do better, especially now that we live in the world of remote employment opportunities. Company was 1901group, now bought out and from I hear even worse then it was before. Again... LOOK AT THE TURNOVERSnacks and paid hollidaysRead over my review. Lack of support from management, terribly stressful, lack of advancement opportunities unless you meet politically advantageous characteristics.good benefitsAs a sfotware devloper, this is a typical day at work:attend daily sprint call;work on assigned tasks or research issues;collaborate with team membersThey have done some forward-thinking work with opioids and substance use disorder.The HR department is not ""on the ball."" They let talent walk out the door and complain about the difficulties of hiring in new people. Most of the other departments are snappier and there are cool things happening in science and technology at Leídos.Great company, if you have a higher degree.I would avoid working here if you’re looking for something entry level, as it really does feellike you’re “bottom of the barrel” and given the tasks that no one else wants to do, i.e. in the call center giving people bad news all day.Great company to work forLeidos is a great company to work for.

Supervisors tend to micro-manage.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Cliquish. Management is haphazard at best. ""Clinical Supervisions"" were just meetings to discuss how to fill out the DAR's but no actual supervision provided regarding client sessions.1It really depends on your role and the contract you work onWhen I first came on as a Junior Dev, I was excited because it was my first job out of college so I was just eager to get my hands on anything. My role required me to have knowledge of C++ and Java in order to support the ""development"" of a legacy application that has been around for quite sometime. About three months into my Junior Software Developer role, I actually found what I was doing to be interesting, but then, the work became repetitive and I slowly started to realize that there was no actual software development; just minor bug fixes here and there that truthfully only needed one dev to work them (most of the time). So, a lot of the time, We ""Developers"" had to make ourselves busy with ""busy work"" which had nothing to do with being a Software Dev (IMO). Your experience with this company IMO will be which contract you are placed on, and what is asked of you. My advice, ask very probing questions about what your specific day-to-day duties will be; sometimes job descriptions stretch the truth...Good benefits and PTO planSome contracts might not be what you are looking forGood first job but wouldn’t stay longThey hired me out of college with no experience so I was grateful for that. But the culture was bad, they worked us so hard everyone was always exhausted, a supervisor tried to get me fired over a 7 cent error, and some managers had no accounting background and it showed. I was definitely ready to leave after two years for better pay, better work environment and more appreciation from my company.Nice location if you live on the east side of Tucson.Mediocre pay, constant push to work more, rarely promoted from within, and then made those they didn’t promote train the outside hire.Dead end jobZero room for promotion, I had to beg to be trained on different projects. There was a sense of favoritism but its hard to prove. Whenever I was ""involved "" in projects I was micromanaged or the Project Coordinator would just take over tasks.Great place to work and really enjoyed the people.Great place to work and really enjoyed the people.

They aren’t family friendly nor do they truly care about your wellness as they preach. The management is horrible and treat you like robots. They also micro manage times 100. If you like to be controlled on and off your work schedule, than this is the job for you. The benefits are junk, pay is descent though. Still not worth the migraine headaches that I endured every day due to the verbal and mental abuse from the callers and management on a weekly basis. Breaks are short. There’s no support from HR either, so don’t waste your time. They will make you work regardless of needing time off for medical appointments. The training time is short for all of the material you need to know. They cram everything, so you don’t have time to retain it all. Yet, you get docked basically for everything when they listen to your calls! They expect you to work on your own personal time and the supervisors text and call you on your own personal cell phone, even on your off-time. They also dock points for being late and absent. You need the whole weekend to recover from the work week and it’s still not enough time. It’s like high-school all over again!Pay, and no weekends.CompanyThe managementManagement is absolutely extraordinary in assisting with upward mobility. They want the best for you. When I started I was not seriously considering staying with the company. I have since changed my mind. They have pushed me to better myself and encouraged me to take risks and supported me the whole way.Willing to work with employeesManagement will always support you if needed. After I came back from leave they allowed me to WFH for almost a year. Pay could be better, but govt contractors win the lowest bid.Great place for general work. Management can be lackluster. Compensation can feel like a slap to the face.The work is usually meaningful and I feel like I can make an impact. Management can make you feel ignored and make your performance review look lackluster. Thus, your worth can be more to other companies.Great Pay but no job securityLeidos compensates their employees very well. However, if you are a federal contractor there is no job security as your contract could end with short notice. Leidos management tries their best to manage at a distance if you are at a customer away from their headquarters. However, there are obviously some things out of their control since they can be so far away.Underpaid, undervalued, over workedA typical day at work, culture, etc. are contingent upon placement of the contract. I LOVE where I am contracted. That said, the benefits are not as advertised and the pay is approximately 48% below average for similar jobs. I also recommend Googling recent business practices.Contract placementBenefits are not as advertised, pay is low. We are discouraged from working overtime to meet customer needs.A good place to work with several avenues for advancement.Overall an excellent place to work. Everyone is on the same team. Executive management promotes good work/life balance and communicates well for a large organization. Good corporate culture that addresses issues that are brought to their attention. Once you are aboard, there are many ways to advance as they prefer to promote from within and retain talent. Even when a contract is ending, management is finding places for their team to go within the company. After 35 years of military and Gov't work, I was impressed with the comradery.Good Experience OverallHuge company. Great opportunities if you have motivation to work hard and take advantage of opportunities presented. Like any big company, it has challenges of trying to keep everyone happy.Plenty of areas to gain experience in project management and supporting functions.If you want lots of direction and organization, probably not the best company to consider.Good companyEnjoyed working there. Work on a contract with rebid competition for A DoD organization on a military base. Long term stability was an unknown because at the end of an awarded contract you never know if your company was going to win a repeat.Contractual Job with long term stability unknownGreat company, poor compensationLove the company and its mission. Great flexibility and work/life balance. Management has been great in TRYING to give individuals what they deserve but the powers-to-be refuses to pay or promote from within. Boss said at my last review it would be easier to get promoted if I quit, and reapplied than if I were to stay on.Great opportunity to learnLeidos was a great place to work post-military and a good introduction to the civilian workforce. The company cares about its employees. I did feel like an outsider at first, but that could be a result of the fact that the program I joined had been together for a long time."
Etsy,"Incredible Company Culture - Treat employees very well.I've been with Etsy for almost 17 months now. It's been a great company to work for. They are very respectful of employee and contractor time and believe in a healthy balance, including mental health days, several free days off each year (beyond holidays) and so much more.Great pay, respectful people, blameless culture1WonderfulIf you run your own shop it is a nice online place to advertise your goods and I think it usually (depending on the store) provide wonderful customer service and are quick to respond to any concerns.Productive and funEveryday was a fun time. Co-workers are great and management in fair. Paid time off and I always felt like I could brain storm and collaborate with the team.1Etsy will bring you the customerLove/hate relationship. Etsy has done a lot for small businesses over the years. And they continue to try... That said, somethings were definitely lost when it went public a few years ago .Not greatWay to many fees for subpar help. They recently increased fees and now sellers are fed up. They need to fix a lot if they actually want to help sellersFun place to workIt’s a great place to work. This place offers flexibility. It’s good for stay at home moms etc. I would recommend it to people I care about s they have a lot to offer.A great creative outletEnjoyed starting a side hustle on this site. Easy to navigate, lots of tools to use, and a great place to learn. The algorithm can be horrible and changes fast, however. My sales dropped out of nowhere one day because they kept changing what pages get to be viewed, so don’t be fooled by the boost they give new sellers either. Customer service could also be way better.FineWorking with Etsy was fine. The work can be stressful, but everything always worked out in the end. I would recommend working with them to sell your products.Good as a side hustleEtsy allows me to work at my own pace, and I would say the fees are fairly reasonable. However, I do not like their advertising approach, in which you pay a fee if your item is purchased from an ad which you do not actively put up. Still, I have not encountered this myself and would absolutely recommend giving setting up an Etsy shop a try. It is possible to do it full time, but unless your items are niche, the algorithm does not pick up a whole lot of new creators, unfortunately, so it requires a good amount of promo.Very productive!Enjoyed crafting and working with alot of great customers and well known companies. Challenging at times. However, learned so much on how to run my own business.HelloThis job was ok. Nothing special and easy to learn. I imagined that I would work here longer but didn’t. I might go back someday because it’s convenient.I love EtsyEtsy is an awesome platform to put your artwork. I started an Etsy shop because I love painting but didn't have any place to put my extra artwork. I wouldn't recommend living off of Etsy or even depending on it for money, but I'll probably always have it just for fun and connecting with people around the world.flexible scheduleno benefits, hard to get work seenFlexible Schedule- Work/Life BalanceEtsy allowed me to stay at home with my children when they were younger.

The company is full of relented, unique, and supportive people. I was incredibly proud to be able to work there and support the goals they aim accomplish.As a neurodiverse person however, there was a lack of understanding of the challenges this presented for me. While management was incredibly supportive and seemed to truly care about admin's progress and goals, their was some lack of insight into the support and feedback some employees may need.That being the only major concern, I would highly recommend seeking out Etsy for job opptunity. I have no doubt that given the chance to learn from these shortcomings, the company would address themBenefits, talented supported staff and management, social responsibilityPromotion bottlenecks, falls short on neurodiversity supportGreatIt's a great place to start as a small business owner. Etsy helps with driving traffic to your shop. It's easy to use and navigate. You can work on your own time. Only downside are fees.Flexible schedule managing online store.Overall nice experience selling on Etsy. Some regulations and company policies could be better. Satisfying clients is not hard but Etsy rarely supports sellers and give reason to customer.Flexibility.Lack of support to sellers.Good for start up small businessGood for start up small business, they do take a lot of the profits. They have a good marketing strategy for new sellers which make it easy to sell the productsIndependentEtsy is a marketplace for independent sellers. The sign up process is easy and income is based on the work out into it, so when items sell themselves it's nice yet sometimes it's worth the effort to promote sales.FlexibityListings set to Manual renewal do not have reminders..Cool at first, then the kool-aid wears offPerks were great and company was very forward thinking.Felt very click-y and productivity levels were non-negotiable.Not a lot of ways to advance.flexible hours, free snacks and lunches, progressive cultureunrealistic expectationsIncredible Company Culture - Treat employees very well.I've been with Etsy for almost 17 months now.

It’s easy to maneuver the website as a buyer and seller. Plus you get to buy shipping labels from them instead of uspsFlexible and FunI love being able to work from home and sell my handmade items that I design myself. Etsy gives me the creative and financial freedom to run my own small business. Because of Etsy, being able to pursue my craft is possible!Best Place I've WorkedEtsy was the definition of a great place to work! They truly care about their employees and the community of sellers and buyers. Its full of good, smart, hard working people and solid leadership. I would recommend it and go back in a heartbeat!People, Benefits, Culture, MissionGrowing pains (when I was there a couple of years ago)Great Place to Get your Product Out thereI run a small shop off Etsy and it's definitely allowed me to reach more customers than I would of traditionally selling. The fees are somewhat high but overall it definitely boosts salesSelf employmentSell what you want, when you want, for whatever price you want. You have full control of your job with a nice platform to help you manage your sells. They also help with advertisement to increase your sells. Cons are that you work alone, your income depends on sales, there are extra fees, shipping can be a hassle, and there aren’t any benefits. But the job is perfect for people who want to sell their art, on their time, and with their stipulations.Self managing, work from home.No benefits, coworkers, or guaranteed incomeSuch a fun place to work atI really liked working here, the people are the best part. Everyone likes to come to work and is happy on a day to day basis. No big complaints on managementUnfair compsnyWould never work there. They can shut your shop down for no reason. You loose your your income and they don’t respond when you contact them. Horrible customer serviceEthical Workplace with Terrible ManagementEtsy truly seemed like a wonderful place to work before I actually worked here. Even while I'm currently working here, I see its amazing purpose, its ethical business practices, its emphasis on diversity and inclusion, and its quirky workplace culture. With that being said, your experience at Etsy will depend on what team you're on. In my current team, my manager does not care at all about my career development, my well-being, and my co-workers and I are often scoffed at for continuously seeking career development opportunities even though we were promised them when we interviewed for our roles. We feel disrespected and undervalued.mental health holidays, C-suite transparencylack of career development opportunities, burn-out, managementFreedomFreedom to navigate your own path.

I would like more ads to influence people to come and look so people can make more profit. It’s a nice site though.Great place.... until it wasn'tOverall I loved my time at Etsy. The office was amazing, ability to WFH, culture, events, etc were the best of any job I have had. The pay and benefits are amazing, too! I was in seller support payments, which was a VERY tough role with a ton of intricate background work necessary. Looking back, I think I was too emotional for the job, as Etsy wants you to follow the resource articles and be pretty ""black and white"" about payment decisions. I was having some trouble grasping the payment concepts and after 7 months I was put on a performance improvement plan and through that, improved a lot and drastically raised my customer experience score. I was told by my manager in private meetings that even if for some reason the role of payments didn't work out, she would work with me on transferring me to another team. This proved to be completely false. I came into work June 2019 expecting to meet with my manager and HR to discuss the completion of the Performance Improvement Plan. Since I had improved so much and raised my score, along with verbally being told prior by my manager that she would still work with me in another team, was under the impression that there would be no issues. Instead, I was completely blindsided that morning and let go.... to say I am still shocked is an understatement. I believe other things were involved whether it be politics or whatever. I'm still not sure what happened but have since gone on to start my own business for the past year and a half. Etsy was great and I have no hard feelings but I would be wary of the Seller Support Payments team in particular.Benefits, office environment, pay, Wfh, culture, prideUntrustworthy managementProductive and welcoming environmentIt’s really nice to have your own schedule and be able to express your creativity with your own business. Learning from other creators is a huge perk of working with Etsy and it teaches valuable skills about time management, organization and more.Fun side hustleIt’s great to be able to have an idea and run with it. I’ll likely return to Etsy when I have time to spare again. There’s something really special about the way they allow creativity to be sold online.I am an online store owner using Etsy as a platform so I can't speak for the actual, physical company.Very user friendly, both from a customer and store owner standpoint.

It has allowed me to be both creative and administrative. It gives me complete flexibility as I work mostly from home. I am also able to donate a portion of my proceeds.OverallIt was an awesome place to work. The position included a lot of different responsibilities you had to do. Fast paced & overall rewarding. I loved working here.Work from homeI work from home making jewelry so it is time consuming and I have to bring my own traffic and it usually doesn't pay off but it is a learning experience.Incredible Company Culture - Treat employees very well.I've been with Etsy for almost 17 months now.

However, they clearly did not have a clear vision that they were attempting to achieve during my contract there. Furthermore, they did not have an understanding of Project Management as an expertise or a foundation with which to build their upcoming campaigns on. While everyone had wonderful intentions, it was a failed opportunity for myself as the employee and the team that hired me.2Etsy is full of creative possibilitesEtsy is nice because you can work as much or as little as you like.

I'd recommend it to any small creative business owner looking to sell their wares or even just getting their feet wet.Great place if you have a stand out productFees continue to go up but overall, a great startup if you have a stand out product.

The fees are a little to high in my opinion and they dont explain to potential customers that you are just a single person not some one who works in a big etsy facility.Easy and ProductiveEtsy is a great place to work at if you need to work from home. Most enjoyable part of the job was selling items.

I left this company to start my own business and I use the things they taught me every day. 10/10 would recommend this company for anyoneAfter putting in years of service I was discarded without notice or reason.No room for growth and was discarded without reason. There is no job security for contractors working at Radiance. They did little to find me another position at NASIC.BenefitsNo job security or advancementsProductive and a great place to workGreat experience mixed with alot of great people to work with. Family First Mission oriented. Team Friendly environment. Radiance makes you feel like you are a part of something specialA Fast Growing Company with Amazing BenefitsRadiance has an excellent benefits package which is enough to get almost anyone in the door. I worked two different jobs here, and the first one had a terrible manager, and the second one has been my favorite employment yet. Flexible work hours, management has been spotty due to high turnover, but overall a great job. Work/life balance needs improvement—overall, a decent company to work for.Excellent Benefits Package. Flexible work schedule. Family FriendlyManagement turnover is high. Work/Life Balance needs improvement.Leadership is outstanding and very approachableProvided contract support to government customer so my focus was supporting the government customer and ensuring we met all the contract requirements to customer. Company leadership is outstanding. Tough to move into corporate leadership role.CEO is a horrible manThey only let their buddies advance and sit around and then sit around and do nothing. It’s a good company if you are not in the corporate building.Great benefitsManagementInteresting work, lower payThe benefits and the work culture were great. The people were smart and helpful. The work was interesting. I learned something new every day. My biggest complaints are with compensation, and the roadmap to workplace advancement.

I have learned a tremendous amount of information and have gained so much confidence in my field. I would recommend this company to anyone.Ok workIt's a job. We don't know our schedule until the day before. It's a job that is easy to get along with others if its the type that u like. Others job are worse. Goals are met. If not weekends are needed. Whst else can I say to get this to go through?TimeDramaGood companyGood company with good compensation and benefits. They treated me fairly and I'd definitely work there again. I worked off-site at down range locations so I can't really speak to life in Huntsville.Good for the most partAs a company as a whole it was good and benefits were good and pay was good for starting salary. The hours were not bad. The only problem was that everypne was out for them selves and tje team concept was lost.PayLocal leadershipExcellent benefits.Radiance has excellent benefits. That is why I went to work there. It is a fast growing company that is quickly outgrowing its family-type atmosphere.Fantastic benefits.Lack of upward mobility.Benefits and the peopleGood Benefits and nice folks. Good programs.

It takes care of its employees very well!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Poor line managementWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Worked off site at client siteWorkHas a lot to do for work. Experience and learning is always expanding in the job. Hard work is always noticed and compensated with bonuses. Management is very easy going and will work with you as long as you are upfront and truthful. The company really tries to be as accommodating as possible. Management ensures that work environments are not stressful. As issue brought up to Radiance's supervisors will be addressed regardless of the customer you are working for. Radiance really tries to take care of their employees for the long haul. I personally have turned down other jobs even if the pay was more because its hard to find a great paying job with a good working environment.Productive and fun place to workA typical work day for me was 7 to 3:30 or 4. Nice atmosphere and good people to work with.-there was not anything really hard about the job.- the most enjoyable thing about the job was we lost our contract and the company picked me up and gave me a job.Good company to work for.Did really like the getting paid 2 times a month verses every 2 weeks.Great company to work for!Radiance truly were a great company to work for. I worked there for over 6 years, had a great time, great management and growth. I thank Radiance for taking care of its employees.

The working conditions were terrible and the rotating shift schedule was terrible. There was no opportunity for advancement.Good payTerrible rotating shift scheduleGood place to workOverall good place to work. Benefits are ok, 401k is a little different than a traditional matching. Radiance is growing rapidly and keeps being awarded new contracts.Great Company!!The time I spent with Radiance was great. They provided me with a great overseas opportunity and were very understanding when I needed to leave for something closer to my hometown. The benefits were great and I'd definitely work for them in the future if an opportunity presented itself.Great Benefits, Promote from withinDecent CompanyThis is an OK company to work for, though the work is satisfying there is little room for advancement. I would recommend this as an interim or starter position to anyone.Long hours but good scheduleRadiance technologies is a good company to work for overall. Their biggest problem within Ft Gordon is they promote people in management spots that are not qualified for the position.Overall good company to work forThey promote unqualified people to higher positionsGreat company to work forVery fair work salary and incentives. Very good place to work. As with any company, there are pros and cons. Just get over them and move on if you don't like something.EhIt's a lot, not a bad place to work but it very demanding on your personal life, other than that they compensate well, everyones very friendly but it's a cliqued up work environmentGood CompayThe company is good with excellent benefits and pay.

Good benefits, good working hours, good people to work with. Laid-back and low stress job but must have excellent skills to keep up.Professionalism and complete support to me when deployedRadiance Technologies demonstrated extreme professionalism and support to me when deployed as a CAT II linguist. They never failed to show how much they cared about me as their employee by following up with me and providing the help and support I needed in order for me to do my job. I truly appreciated and loved those qualities in Radiance Technologies in which it helped me give the best I can give to support our mission and our troops when deployed.It took away unnecessary stress and gave me the opportunity to work hard without worries! and enjoyed the other part of the job which is supporting our troops, be there for them whenever they needed me, and serving my country.Work without supervisionLong working hoursGreat Company & Great BenefitsGreat Company & Great BenefitsTop of industry salary.

No fault of the mine or the company.13Awesome Place to workGreat ""please first"" culture. One of the best places I have ever worked. The management was amazing. Wish I could have stayed longer, but the downfalls of contracting got the better of me.2Good CompanyGood Company, Great co-workers. Company is changing with influx of younger talent. Great Benefits, among the best in the business. Senior Leadership depends on dynamics in each group. Executive Leadership out of touch with workers. Loyalty appears to be a one way street.great companygreat company with high potential for expansion. was a deployed contractor for them and although your position was the complete opposite of the normal persons everyday schedule they made sure to promptly tend to your needs.FMV AnalystContract work that includes panama schedule with excellent benefits. Provides additional employment opportunities across a myriad of skillsets. I would recommend this organization to anyone with the skillset required to perform the daily requirements.Good CompanyTreat you well and reward loyalty. Was a company that I stumbled upon but I am glad that I did as it was a learning experience and led to other great opportunities.Good place to workRadiance is an excellent company to work for. They are a small company, but are still able to provide an environment to help its employee's grow in their careers.An enjoyable place to work.A good place to work and know what to expect when you show up. The environment is spirited which helps pass the time. I do think the pay should be better distributed according to overall years of intelligence experience vs someone coming in after serving 4 years and making as much as others with over 15-20 years of intel experience. Food for thought!Relaxed atmosphereJob standards are not all the same between shiftsFun place to work (Employee Owned)Radiance Technologies is one of the best companies I've worked for in my entire adult life thus far. I would recommend this company to anyone who appreciates values and structure.Great Team, Great Management, Good PeopleNo ConsLove the annual profit sharing!Radiance Technologies is a great place to work for. As most company has room for improvements, Radiance has its share of improvements to work on. But, overall I am very proud to be part of the Radiances Family. I say family, because Radiance treats employees as family. It is an employee owned company and shares the company fairly among each and every employee. Not too many companies in INTEL world can earn this respect from employees.Great BenefitsGreat pay!If you want to work long hours, but get paid for it, this is the place. Moving up can be a challenge. Kiss the ring and one will go far.PayManagementGood company to work forRadiance is a great company to work for as it provides employee ownership, good benefits and for the most part you are left alone to accomplish your job. The company needs to focus on the program manager / site lead as they plays favoritism and for the most part the program manager / site leads are not qualified to manage a large group of employees. The program manager / site lead is not experienced in management and not very approachable to work with. Most employees are very unhappy with their program manager / site leads and the company need to do something about it or they will lose their most important assets ""their employees"".Good BenefitsPoor and unqualified Program Manager and Site leadProductive and Honorable workplaceUsually work a ""Panama Shift"" schedule.Work 12 hour shiftsWork with very competent and team attitude co-workersHardest part is working away from my family and hometown.But working with these people makes it all better...The jobbeing away from familyThey Take Care of Their EmployeesI have loved working for Radiance technologies. They have a great work atmosphere and an incredible relationship with their contract clients. I have only seen and worked with high caliber individuals who I am positive they have their employee base well-being in mind.great retirement planThe company is nothing more then the government contracts it hasI worked at home for a US Government client, the National Security Agency on Intellink and OSIS. Management was completely absent.Once the company had neglected the contract sufficiently and it was cancelled all the staff were immediately fired. No warning was given.I would not ever accept nor seek a position with such a hollow firm. I do not suggest you do either.Absent management, no co-workers to bother youZero job stability, horrible managers, inexperienced staffGood company, poor management.A day in the life of a Radiance Employee (in Augusta) is long and boring. I learned that work ethic and experience are second to who you know within company in regards to advancement and pay. Co-workers are great, some do not get paid enough, others get paid too much (this is typical in any office due to the above). The hardest part of the job is coping with the 12 hour shifts and mundane work. Unfortunately, the best part of the day was the end of shift.Good pay, flexible with time offPoor managment, favoritismThere were excellent job opportunities and the pay for the work done was appropriate.Management locally was timely and kept the employees informed of what was to come as well as what was going on. The central management was not well informed and kept the site employees at a distance as far as being involved with business between sites and home office. Wonderful opportunities for those who work and manage for the company.Wonderful opportunities and the constant need to advance was there.Communication between sites through the central officeDo not work directly for the companyAs a government contractor, I do not work directly for the company. I work directly for my government customer in a government facility.Fun place to work.Excellent management and good co-workers. Flexible Schedule and fun place to workJust too good of a companyAll is good with this company since now they have WEEDED out their WEEDs.All goodNone"

The interview process isn’t easy, and you go through quite a few interviews to get to “the offer” but it’s well worth it. Knowing that your colleagues went through the same process and were all able to weigh in on every individual that joins the team really makes this company special. They are focused on who they are working with and if they would be a good fit, and not just what their resumes may say about them.RF-SMART is one of the first company’s that I have worked for that publicly announce their values and actually adhere to them. They are written on the walls of the offices and brought up in meeting and interviews. The values they have put out for all employees to follow really mean something to leadership and they stand by them.The most enjoyable part of working for RF-SMART for me as a scrum master, is being able to try new things and being ENCOURAGED to “fail fast”. I don’t think I have ever worked at a company who preached “fail fast” and followed that statement with their actions. We have tried many thingsLeadership, Culture, massage therapists come in once a month, great break area with ping pong and other games, free breakfast and snacks multiple times a week401k fully vested takes 6 yearsIncredible culture designed to grow you both professionally and personallyRF-SMART has a culture like no other that is pushed from the top down. Management lives out the core values of RF-SMART which spreads like a wave through the whole company and into the lives of our customers. Working at RF-SMART is not an easy job regardless of the role. You will be pushed harder than you thought you were capable of achieving but will be rewarded for your efforts. RF-SMART is a company that pushes it's employees to be better every day and has lots of fun along the way. If you want to grow in your career and skill sets and have a company that backs you up, supports, and rewards your efforts then RF-SMART is great for you.Growing company that is mission driven and values basedRF-SMART is family owned and you can tell! The way they treat their employees reflects that they see their people as more than cogs in a wheel. The mobile data collection industry is fast pace and dynamic and the company is a long-time leader in that space.Each part of the business is growing which makes joining the team easy and accommodating. The offices have the standard software company feel with post-work beer nights, a great break room area, and lots of engaging events for people and their families to participate in.The company lives out their values in a variety of ways, practicing what they preach.Free breakfast twice a week, blended work schedule (3 in office/2 WFH), healthcare benefits immediatelySix years until fully vested retirementThe best place I've ever workedRF-SMART truly cares about their people. Everything you read and hear about the company is true and lived out everyday. The company is dedicated to growth through it's people, products and finances. We work hard, but have so much fun along the way. The culture is absolutely top notch and the company truly lives out it's mission of ""Having each other's back"" and ""Being crazy for our customers"". One of my favorite things about RF-SMART is it's financial stability, as the company is completely debt free and does not borrow money. We even teach Financial Peace at RF-SMART.Work from anywhere policy, Growth Opportunities, Culture, Leadership401k vesting scheduleTwo faced managementThis place is run like a cult. Lots of smiles but when covid hit the blame game began. There was ZERO product training and no support when things in the economy went bad."

Home Depot / THD,"Cool chill environmentIt’s okay co workers are good and management can be a drag sometimes but if you keep your hand down and focus on work you shouldn’t have to much to worry aboutOpen work environmentNo overtimeIt was a good environment but very hard to get a full time positionThe compensation was minimal compared to the amount of work expected. Management needs to recognize the people that shine and want to make this a careerGo elsewhere.Worst job ever. Incompetent and ignorant supervisors play favorites. Expected to work nonstop for poor salary, 50¢ raises and bonuses of less than $200. Team member gets away with threatening co-workers. Any normal employer would of fired the worker on the spot. This one received a reward! Training consists of being dumped in front of a desktop computer. No oppty for advancement or career path. If you like working in an environment where you're constantly monitored, hard work goes unrecognized and people who don't do anything are rewarded, then this is the job for you.1UnderstaffedToo much work put on your shoulders while supervisors and tenured employees sit back and relax. Same people get recognition at monthly meetings while the true workers are pushed into the shadowsProductive and repetitiveI unloaded trucks and stocked shelves overnight and it just got to be so repetitive and boring. We were a high volume store so there was a lot of freight to unload and stock most nights. Management didn’t really care for the employees. Every night we’d get told about how sales goals were crushed while having to beg for so much as a gift card for our work.Work was fun but hard. UnderpaidCo workers we’re helpful and friendly, the work was hard always short staffed even during holidays. Not enough hours or pay. Website never right which causes arguments between customers and employees.Co workersManagementI highly suggest working for Home Depot if you hate yourself.They will not care if you’re sick and dying they will clock you out before calling anyone. (True story) Depot I worked at is a great place to work as long as you roll over and let them over work, under pay you and degrade you no matter how long, hard and well you work for them. Do not go into Home Depot #6549 expecting managers to care about you or your well being. They expect you to bleed orange and die for the Home Depot.Mandatory breaks on 4+ hour shiftsGet chewed out for taking your breaks.Fast pacedLots of responsibility comes along with the service desk. Being nice can cost you with certain customers. Overall a fun place to work and meet people.Great Place to LearnMoney was not great compared to same job title at other companies, but training is better than most, as long as you are open to it. I received a lot of in depth training that helped propel me into my career.customer serviceGood company to work for. Management gets involved and associates are appreciated. Good benefits and flexibility. Safety is enforced and company is very focus on improving constantly.fun place to work, though understaffedMy time at the home depot I worked in lumber, was pretty fast paced through the day but chilled out towards closing. Only negative I can think of is contractors coming in and being rude to staff.contractorsProductive and very demandingSo far so good and i am enjoying working with home Depot.Career development is a priority.High level stakeholder.Work priority is key.Encouragement and guidance.Decent work placeI would recommend working at the Home Depot as a first time job or someone looking to produce some part-time/ temporary income. I would consider it as more of a stepping stone. There isn’t much room for advancement due to signs favoritism at my specific location.2 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Pay was on timeWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The store I worked at tolerated workplace harassment.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic.Older female associates were treated by male department supervisorsWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?I reported to work on time but never knew when I’d be able to leave.Managers always play favorites for promotionsIf you have any interest in moving up, you better kiss up to your asms, or you'll just be left in the same spot you're in until you leave that dump. No raises, or recognition.pay is decentVery cliquey. Managers like who they like and promote their ""friends"" Workers are often treated as children, especially in monthly meetings. Pay is competitive for the area.Overall not badManagement is pretty good at communication, makes it seem like the job is meaningful. Aside from customers not being the best at times, the job is not at all that badGreat companyGreat company that offers great benefits and tries to create an environment that is easy to be in. I would recommend working for The Home Depot. They are a great company.Decent workI worked as a freight associate. I was on the unload crew which meant that I unloaded trucks. Then we would all put the freight away on the shelves or the overhead storage. It was very physical work. The pay did not reflect the amount of effort needed to perform the job. Started at 12 an hour and eventually, through the company raising it's minimum slowly overtime, ended at 15 an hour. Better, but not a lot.Frequent breaks, Good managementPay, CorporateI felt appreciated by my peers and by my managers. Culture is solid.I’m blessed to have worked for THD and able to retire from there. They talk about culture, then follow it up with actions. They care about their customers, associates, and your families. They stressed a home/work balance. I loved my time there.Compensation, schedule, people, growth opportunities.NoneIt's alrightIf you're looking for a pretty okay place to work this is it. Nothing special, very average underpaid career. Management can be hit or miss. Over all, okay.Great coworkers, friendly.Extremely anti-union.

Average 20 a week. There was a lot of other employees also asking for more hours. At least the max for part time. But nope. And they steadily hiring new people everyday. They would advertise to get new people. I couldn't pay my rent with 20-25 hrs a week..and I got kids I can't work 2 jobs.

One of the best perks is they promote within. so your able to grow with the HD not just financially.Very fast paced and exploitive work enviornmentManagement seems to rely on a few hardworking associates to do 90% of the work while the rest are treated more like children that need to be constantly monitored. A typical day would include customer service, down stocking merchandise, returning product to shelves, and any other department specific duties.Benefits are very good and good opportunity for long term advancementVery stressful work environment and heavy workloadGood coworkersNice work environment, very flexible with your schedule. Coworkers are very nice and welcoming but management can either be fair or give you a hard time.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?For a company they take care of their employees. From profit sharing to great benefits and the hourly rate wasn’t bad either.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The stores are busy places, with customers that are in a hurry and need help.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The people I worked for were nice people, and so were the people I worked with. For the most part everyone worked very hard.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Waiting on customersWork PlaceI am a flooring sales person, so typically I do measures on customers carpets, and tile installations. It is a very nice place to work if you are a veteran. The hardest part of the job is dealing with so many customers because you never know if someone is having a bad day, so we are here to sell products and make their day better.as good as the team you work withreally enjoyed my time in customer service, it is a good place to learn and start your working experience and they make sure you have the necessary training to do your job.2 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Friendly Coworkers, longer meal breaks 1hour meal breaks and 15 minute rest breaks.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Store is always changing, over 1,000s of items and 100s are similar so it is confusing helping customers. Getting ahold of associates in other departments is almost always a challenge. Managers refuse to give full time hours when asked for. Customers are agressive often. Self Checkout machines are broken or down everyday.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic, fast paced, frustratingWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Cashiers must greet anyone who passes by them. Cashiers must assist customers in self checkout and that can lead to agressive and awkward situations. There are cashiers in Garden, Checkout, Customer Service, and Pro Desk, being knowledgeable in these departments helps a little but it's hard to know everything leaving customers sometimes confused and frustrated on finding things.great place to workGenuinely cares about employees and customers. Employees are listened to about issues with policy or procedures. Gives the tools to care for and assist with customers' issues and complaints.Employee appreciation, great time off, gives tools to assist customers with issuesSome customers can be nastyUnderstaffed and Erratic SchedulesA workday can start at 6:00 AM or can end at 9:00 PM, with those start and stop times occurring multiple times in the same week. The store is understaffed, and extra help isn't being sought for my department.Fun WorkplaceI was there for a couple of months and I found friendships that will last a lifetime. They were so inviting and easy to learn from. I loved every part of that placeDecent people. Busy work. And bad managmentGetting full time is a very long waiting game and they'll absolutely get their money's worth making sure you don't work over time even then. The store is always crowded because there's too much stuff coming in the trucks but never anything you need, the customers also hate the clutter. You'll constantly be going back and forth because management can't decided uniformly who does what or even what needs to be done and how.Fun work environment and good benefitsCoworkers are great, management is very responsive, a lot of opportunity to grow within the company. 15 minute breaks offered every 2 hours. Good pay. Good benefits. Definitely recommendCool chill environmentIt’s okay co workers are good and management can be a drag sometimes but if you keep your hand down and focus on work you shouldn’t have to much to worry aboutOpen work environmentNo overtimeGood work placeA fun work place, but when it comes to working in the customer service you are pressured to do things right and always do it right, working on the sales floor is stressing it’s self since most likely you might be the only one on shift. But over all it gives you some great opportunities.Stores do holiday potlucksMaking sure you get things done but also help all customers at all times, making sure you get 10 hours worth of stuff in the time of your shiftNo communication between management. And absolutely no companion or care!When it come to communication between management. There isn't any at all! One manager puts a new rule or policy in place then another manager comes and changes it. And what ends up happening is a employee ends up being told they did something wrong or a customer gets upset. And with employees. Manager have no care or compassion for the well being of there physical health. One instance. A employee had a broken bone. A injury that did not happen at work. But was still required to do heavy loads for customer and resulting is very slow healing if any at all or additional trama..1Productive and SafeHome Depot as a corparate job, is a great way to pick up in your life since there are lots of opportunities about promotion. However, some of supervisors are rude and all. Again, I am happy to work with them.Not badHave been employed part time for three years. For the most part I like it. The try to match my hours with my availability and my wage is ok, not great though. I am older and do find many of the young people to be disrespecting of doing their jobs the right way, and unfriendly toward others who are not in their age group or nationality.Customer Service was ighttttHome Depot was an ok job I worked customer service. We would process returns and any online orders and curbside pick up. Got a little repetitive after a while.Fairly standard retail environment.Fairly uneventful and simple work environment with reasonable wages and non-demanding responsibilities bar the occasional short staffed shift. I will say, however, that the management at the Snohomish location seems to be entirely uninterested in actually helping employees when needed and some of the superior cashiering staff are absolutely insufferable people last I interacted with them.Throughly unbalanced work/life structure.The worst place I’ve ever worked. Treated poorly by management and customers. Every day work hours are different, can close at 10pm and open the next morning at 6am. Pay is low. Staff walks around like the walking dead, no enthusiasm, trying to avoid customers. Don’t bother learning coworkers names, with 80% turnover, you can’t. New faces each day. It’s a hellscape. If you have to… use it and lose it!Better than nothingLeaves you with nothingPretty good placeFun coworkers and fair pay. Work isn't hard. Management is a bit hard to get ahold of if you have any questions or concerns. Overall I would recommendgreat atmospherelots of standingBad place to work if you are strugglingI had a lot going on while working here. I ended up in the hospital a few times. Got my car taken away from me etc. They wouldn't receive my doctor's not as proof. They are big on attendance here. So if you have family emergencies they don't respect it. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you already have your life in order.Quarterly bonus, in depth training, nice people, helpful superiorsWeekends required, low pay rate, not a good work/life balance, strict HRToo much favoritism, lies, deceptionThe managers will say they only will give full time if you drive a machine, but some of us who drive machines still don't get full time. They will lead you on as if you're getting promoted just to keep you at a stand still, that is unless you're making jokes with them and you're befriending a role for advancement.Periodic recognitionhealthcare, liesBleeding OrangeThis is a great overall company to work for. Experiences may vary store to store, as in most large companies with multiple locations. THD really has a great culture of taking care of their associates...They helped me with $1500 toward a new engine for my truck.

Fast paced and lots of heavy lifting but overall this is the best retail job i’ve hadDecent jobit was decent job. I got to learn a few things. This was my first ever job.

One Medical,"Great management and workflow for a fairly new medical companyI loved working there. The work was challenging, I was patient facing and back of house admin. The management team was genuinely the best I’ve ever worked with. Their training process after being hired is SUPERB. Would recommend this company to anyone looking to work in the medical field one way or another. The most compassionate and goal driven company I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.Management, work/life balance, easy going environmentExpensive medical insurance (but the coverage was FANTASTIC, I didn’t pay out of pocket ONCE)95DisappointingOne medical purchased Iora Primary care and the transition was beyond disappointing. Staff is stretched thin and miserable. Management lacks the transparency that used to make it feel like a true team environment. Upper management is avoidant and cold. As a company claiming to transform Healthcare, they are taking several steps back. Staff genuinely cares but can no longer provide the care patients are accustomed to and deserve. Overall, one medical has made it clear they are completely out of touch with the higher level needs of the geriatric population and uninterested in employee feedback and satisfaction.Amazing colleagues and patients, benefitsNo breaks, lack of staffingGaslighting was rampantI worked as a provider at a One Medical office for a few years, and found that the OMD gaslighted the providers, and pressured us into prescribing excess controlled substances. Patient satisfaction consistently mattered more than quality medicine. Management tried to pressure me into putting my license at risk. I do not recommend working here if protecting your license is a priority.Lunch breakGaslighting providers, patient satisfaction superseded quality careMost people really care, progressive environment, but sustainability falls on the backs of field teamsOverall the mission is fantastic, you work with people that care and find yourself surrounded by hard workers. Heroic work happens every single day. However, on the ground floor you have lab techs and managers sobbing from stress and bonding over burnout because onboarding cannot keep up with the need and/or finance doesn’t approve the staff necessary for teams to feel supported. Turnover increases year after year. Leaders cover substantial gaps in staffing with no additional pay. No bonuses other than RSUs that don’t vest for 4+ years. Providers generally like their environment and work load; the company (for obvious reasons) focuses on their work/life balance and it’s sustainability. There has been much improvement in BIPOC inclusivity but it’s still not reflected on the c-suite level. There is no negotiating possible at One Medical, at any level.Free snacks, good people that care about patientsStaffing doesn’t keep up with company growth, No bonuses, Field management teams act as a catch-all, minimal development trainingFun meaningful workThis is a job where you can make it fun and really bond with your team or just do your own thing. I appreciate they truly listen to all of the concerns brought up and want feedback. I feel like I can come to my lead, manager, providers, on-site counselors with any problem and they will help me find a solution.Good to start your career, growth is stagnantWhen you first start off, it's actually pretty great. Every day is a new challenge and you meet all sorts of people.Just don't expect too much in the way of growth, unless you're more than professionally chummy with a direct supervisor.Productive & supportive work environment, full of opportunity.One Medical was an amazing company to work for. The goal & purpose of the company is great, & my team was even better. I was hired as a Phlebotomist to which the job title was changed to Lab Services Specialist to recognize the range of tasks we actually completed. The commute at my particular location was tough because it was in the city with very expensive parking. The job itself was an amazing experience in a great work environment. I truly enjoyed it.Learn a lot, meaningful goals, good team, good benefitsLong days, pay for parkingGreat place to start your healthcare career!OM offers great work environment where each member of the team feels involved and appreciated no matter what rank they have within the healthcare system. Teamwork is one of the core values of OM. Highly recommended!Pay, Teamwork, Work-life balance, growth opportunitiesNoneProductive and engaging work placeWorking at One Medical provided me the opportunity to grow professionally as an aspiring provider as I got to learn from my team of physicians, PAs, and NPs while engaging with patients.The worst place to work atPlease do not even waste your time coming to this company! Upper leadership is AWFUL! They are very incompetent, lack of knowledge, lack of compassion and lack of support. The lowest paying market and it shows. These people in this company are very sneaky and will not tell you anything until it’s already established in their way! There is NO ROOM TO GROW! So if you come in one position you are going to be in that position the rest of your time working there! Upper management is awful at communicating with anything, they change the “standard work” every day to cover their a**. Upper management, HR and ever their bosses know NOTHING about the company, about anybody roiled or anything! If you want compassion, and empathy at a job this is the wrong job for you. You are on the computer doing another markets work because they can’t seem to work load under control. The WORST company I have worked at since I’ve moved to Houston.My manger and office team were bomb! And lunchesIncompetency, lack of communication, no room to grow, Everybody is sneakyHorrible ExperienceTook a contract role and was exceeding above expectations still management poor leadership and care. Very disconnected and everyone out for themselves. Gossip environment as well.Medical Office Desk jobIt's an ok place, no opportunities for advancement until you've been working here for a year, and no negotiating pay regardless of your experience or your worth.RunThis job nitpicks about every single thing that you do. Too much micromanaging, the only positive is that they are organized & you get an hour lunch. Other than that, this job could be better. You have Way more duties than a pbt, you will be an administrative assistant that answers phones all day long, meetings back to back, short staffed & rude patients. I would not recommend working for this company. They pay the people of color less than what they deserve. They also will let you go without any explanation.If you’re on a contract they will not renew it simply because someone there doesn’t like you. The care team manager and district manager will smile in your face and won’t care if you have a job or not. They are sneaky and show too much favoritism. Go work somewhere else where they will value you and pay you more.Wonderful Providers, Phlebs, and Admins, but Overall Negative ExperienceMy experience at OM was very negative. I left the company after 2 years. I never felt valued or appreciated at OM. I had 5 different managers during the time I was there (including interim managers). The high turnover was definitely upsetting. However, it was the last 5 months that I worked there that were the worst. During this time there was the most manager turnover.I was also not getting the support I needed. There were days that I both opened and closed the office myself on top of the other tasks I needed to do that day (it is impossible to get things done at front desk when you are alone in a high volume office). I was burnt out for months, but stayed for my providers and phlebs. I regret not leaving sooner.There is so much more I can say. At my exit ""interview"" (it was just a google form), I explained my feelings. I truly hope they read that and can learn from it.A great place to start a career!A great team of leaders who support both clinical and operations teams! People come fist here! I enjoy greatly how much I can have a say in matters. Although not every idea is acted on every one is listened to .Great leaders who support you. Amazing growth opportunityA few negative team membersFun Workplace and Opportunity for Advancement. Room for AdjustmentOverall, I really enjoyed my time at One Medical. However, I don't think the pay was very fair for all the work they make you do working virtually. Before I left, things were starting to turn very ""corporate"" if you will. I was able to get promotions and advance, however there were a lot of co-workers that deserved promotions as well but management would continuously to drag their feet. Overall great company to work for, however there is a lot of room for adjustmentOne Medical provides a new and innovative way for health care.All around great company to work for, their greatest asset is the staff. Everyone is willing to answer any questions that you have. A great environment to work in. Wonderful workplace culture. Their workplace environment should be a template for all healthcare facilities.No room for growth/moving too fastThis is a good job for starting out but don't expect to move up here unless you know someone. OR you can move up due to the high turn over rate but your life will be miserable. Had this company actually listened to their employees concerns and thoughts, I might've stayed. Everyone is over-worked and underpaid here. No room for growth and compensation sucks.Reliable, Supportive & Human CenteredWorking at One Medical has definitely opened my eyes to positions that are challenging, enjoying, and human centered. While the work is repetitive, you are constantly learning new things and inspired by those around you. The company really encourages you to succeed.Snacks, fair pay, room for growth, networkingFlexible scheduleAlthough one medical underpays people to do a lot of work and put up with a lot, I definitely enjoyed how family oriented the environment was and how they worked around my schedule.The culture is everythingThis company is one of the most supportive and welcoming that I have worked for in my entire life. They see the best in you and value each and every worker for how hard they work. I can say you will never go unnoticed. I can’t see myself going anywhere else no that I’ve worked here. Such a great leadership aligned and opportunity for growth is unlimited.EverythingShort breaksGreat management and workflow for a fairly new medical companyI loved working there.

They ask way too much for for the rate they’re paying. The office is nice but employees literally started to unionize because of how they were treated.Nice officeLow pay. Bad management2Stay away not worth stressNot the next company to work for super unorganized managers aren’t active managers not on top of anything you end up doing extras work for not so great pay stay far away not worth the stressFree snacksEverything else3Thank you for taking the time to leave a review, and I'm sorry to hear your experience at One Medical was stressful. We recognize our frontline team members have a big job, and we are working hard to hire at an aggressive pace and investing in training resources to make sure every team member has the tools they need to be successful, including managers. I'll share your feedback with our leadership team so we can continue to improve.Amy FinneyVP, OperationsAmazing company!!!This is the best job I have ever had! The culture is amazing and the tech side is heading in the right direction. Interview process is intense, but what they end up with is QUALITY employees who really believe in the mission. I asked so many times “is this place for real? Is this a scam?” Nope! It really is that great! Benefits are fantastic. Every 5 years you get a sabbatical for whatever you want on top of your vacation time! Full pay! You get stock in the company every year. I really feel appreciated! I love this job. If you are thinking of applying, stop everything and just do it! BEST JOB EVER!Great company to be yourself but that’s itOver worked and under paid. Management only care about themselves they do not put your best interest first. And they will sell you a lot of dreams with the perks and benefits.A company that cares and puts their employees firstGreat coworkers, great staff, great compassion for the staff, great location, great management, beautiful office, great pay, they make sure you have everything you need to be productive and comfortableExcellent pay, very flexible, compassionate, lots of free lunchNoneSteady work, but not challengingThis is primary care. Solid place to work, but no real growth. Corporate koolaid is strong here. Compensation for management is wildly disproportionate to staff - typical of for profit medicine. Patient population is entitled --Lots of ""I need my adderall, why won't you just give it to me?""Great Workplacehad a great time working here - offices are super modern and clean, coworkers are lovely, days are typically very reasonable and snacks in every kitchen!!Ok jobThe job is ok. I work as an admin assistant, which means I assisted the patients with there paperwork and handled everything as far as the patients concerns. The company pays very well. However, management is trash. The office I worked at seemed like everything was all over the place. They worked the admins like we were dogs and constantly blamed us for patients being upset. In addition to this, they do not give you enough leave. When I had to take off for health reasons, I could not freely majority of the time because I had no leave. Other than the horrible work culture, management and benefits the job was ok. If you are looking for a job that has the whole package other than pay, please look elsewhere.Snacks, pay is greatBenefits, work culture, protection of employeesWhat seems too good to be true, usually is.Was there prior to company going public. Definitely felt more corporate as time went on, especially as things changed when the original owner and founder moved on. Potentially could be a decent fit if your management likes you, you’re okay making below market salary, and have no problem giving in to demanding, entitled patients. As a provider I felt no sense of pride in what I was doing. Most people there seemed miserable at the end, and many moved on after I left. Interestingly enough, they use PA’s in virtual provider roles, which still seems odd to me (very few telemedicine companies do this, due to the fact they must have a supervising MD to oversee them in most states). This was the first place I encountered Physician assistants who were hostile towards Nurse Practitioners (not sure why, and I’ve worked with many in the past) . Most people I met appeared friendly, but it wasn’t authentic. That being said, I know it is a blessing I moved on, as I found my current employer and position that has been the best in my career.good benefits, payment less than other systems but close to the market rangePoor managementPoor respect towards physicians, no appreciation for quality science , oriented only for patient 5 star rating no matter what , high liability environmentno prosas per my reviewOne Medical is a rare gem of a company. Supportive outstanding work environment.One Medical is a great place to work. If you are looking for a job without a dull moment, this is the place for you. Management is supportive, providers are friendly. Love it.Meh.Current OM employee (admin) with multiple “stretch roles” - meaning additional duties without any pay increase but alleged promise of dedicated time per role. Management fluctuates with company growth and is generally decent but sometimes inconsistent at local level but leaves room for growth at the “corporate” level. Little to no “corporate” support for individual regions/markets with a high volume of patient increase daily and an increasing turnover rate of both employees and contractors. Benefits are extensive and basically give you (& your dependents) free healthcare while on their plans and virtually unlimited COVID-19 resources depending on supply.As a company, roughly 75% of patients seem happy overall, maybe 15% have minor issues that they compromise on and 10% who are absolutely awful and may threaten you personally for trying to help them. Every department and team seems to be struggling to keep up with the rapid growth pushed by the executive teams. Also the CEO is treated like a minor celebrity and everyone seems to just agree with it?Benefits (free Mental Health, free Doctor’s visit’s, Pto, etc, ), overall cultureInconsistent, below market average pay for daily large workloadTheir initial mission statementOne Medical gets your attention with thier “too good” to be true mission and how their different from other companies in that they care about their employees. Once your on boarding and training ends though, you are pretty much left to your own devices, especially, if you are an admin. You are automatically expected to take on additional rolls/tasks that you weren’t properly trained to do or even being fairly compensated for.Whenever you try to bring up any valid concerns you are gaslight and belittled. Management will say they are there to support you but all they really do is micro manage you and set “expectations” that aren't always attainable, especially, given how short staffed many offices are and how complex and tedious the tasks can be. There is never any downtime because you have to keep taking on tasks on the side which are kept track of. They care more about meeting “metrics” than actual patient care or providing adequate support and going training to those of us who are keeping the office afloat.Whenever you are told to communicate if you need additional support or training, you aren’t being given the time to learn or absorb much of the information. They will overload you with information during your training and then at any given time, the higher level management can make sudden changes to the “standard” work without giving admins any prior notice so you have to unlearn or relearn something again. Since the company went public, their focus has been more on expansion than maintaining their current offices or supporting existing staff.Bottom line, insteadMostly caring colleagues, some good benefits and free food, snacks, drinks if you are into that.Gaslighting, micromanaging, low wages and no real support or growthChallenging but great cultureGreat culture, fast paced, beautiful offices. Enjoy my coworkers. Seems like there is decent career advancement for MDs. Pay is a little lower than industry standard.Good benefits hide the unreasonable job they askPay is low for the complexity of the job. Benefits are good and people are nice. Be careful and ask thorough questions as the job description and the actual job never match, they have unreasonable expectations. Also currently using Workforce Management, so be prepared to be micro-managed.Snacks, benefits, flexible scheduleMicro-managed, poor internal communicationTerrible work environmentI have never had such a horrible experience at a job. If they don’t like you or you aren’t best friends with them then will fire you. The Congress street location didn’t like me because I was the only white person there. I did my job perfectly. They apparently care more about if they like you or not than caring about patient care. Don’t work here! It’s terrible! They make it seem perfect when in reality it’s a popularity contest.NothingEverythingAmazing patient-facing staffThe people actually doing the face-to-face work are incredible. I've never worked with such dedicated and kind people. Management, however, is a whole other beast. Managers treat employees like they are a nuisance rather than actually developing the people they're in charge of. Legitimate concerns are ignored and you're gaslit, but their poor decisions can't be questioned without retaliation.Great colleagues, okay benefits, pretty officeswhite leadership, very little diversity, not disability friendly, mental health stigma among upper leadershipConstantly changingWe get told we will do one process and the next week it changes . Feel as management has favorites, too many expectation not enough pay . Parking for most is across the street in another building .great staff and locationsIt was great working contract for them. they even provide snacks and beverages for employees and a great break room to de-stress. Can't think of anything not positive about my experience.great work environmentpart-time shiftsWell, at least it's not retailOne Medical is... okay. Okay benefits, okay hours, okay management, okay pay. It's like a lukewarm relationship: not bad enough to leave, but not good enough to be happy with long term.Amazing health insurance, cool & funny coworkers I actually like in real life, nice work spaces, free foodLow team morale across departments, high turnover due in part to rapid expansion, union-busting leadership, irregularly enforced rules and HR policies that vary drastically by locationGreat management and workflow for a fairly new medical companyI loved working there. The work was challenging, I was patient facing and back of house admin. The management team was genuinely the best I’ve ever worked with. Their training process after being hired is SUPERB. Would recommend this company to anyone looking to work in the medical field one way or another. The most compassionate and goal driven company I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.Management, work/life balance, easy going environmentExpensive medical insurance (but the coverage was FANTASTIC, I didn’t pay out of pocket ONCE)95Great team members, but no growth & lots of turnoverVery little growth at this company. Lots of going beyond your job description but bring told that you need to take on even more. Very little transparency. Your team will be different every 3-4 months because of turnover.Great team membersNo growth2burnout and toxic environment without proper supportmicromanagement, asked to do uncomfortable risky things, no work life balance, toxic work environment, favoritism and discrimination, lack of support from managementmost colleagues are supportivesee above3Great teamAwesome place. .people were great. Really supportive team work environment We we are there to help serve a common goal which was making sure everyone...patients got there vaccinations.One hour lunchesNonegreat place to work post-gradReally great place to grow as a recent college grad. The job gives you a lot of skills needed to succeed and move onto bigger, better roles in healthcare.No micromanagement and a fun environmentThis is a great company to work for. I loved every minute of working here and I met a lot of great people along my journey. One Medical was great with helping me to be flexible with school and family issues.Great ManagementLow PayInnovative with growing painsRemote working at its finest, One medical has been doing remote work since before IPO and COVID. The work is rote and can be mundane at times. Entitled and pushy patients.Remote, coworkers, 4 day work weekBoring at times, entitled patients, no opportunities for advancementGood clinical experience, mediocre payYou learn a lot in this position outside of the normal phlebotomist role (ear lavage, ekg, med/vaccine inject, etc), but the pay and benefits aren't that good. Very tecj focused, which does make it much easier to communicate with coworkers, but hourly employees are usually over worked and under appreciated.Learn new skills, great coworkersNot so great management, low pay/benefitsGreat benefits, toxic work environment, get your experience and runI worked there as a phleb for 2 years and from the very beginning it was rough. The management is poor and it is very clear that the company plays favorites with certain roles. Patient demographic is certain offices are very prude and disrespectful and you are expected to tolerate, One Medical doesn't want to lose any patients so they are willing to have you tolerate whatever abuse from their patients. Offices are set up nice and clean, but most staff are rude and lazy, staff that care to work hard and ask questions for better improvement are never recognized for their contributions and are given many more responsibilities without the compensating pay (what also sucks is there is no performance based bonuses). Management and HR don't know what they're doing so it makes the experience there hectic when you need them for support. I was brushed off plenty of times. I wish arriving to work, being polite, and getting your work done efficiently were enough for this place but there is always a load of drama and gossip, people need to grow up. Benefits were great, pay was barely okay, but it doesn't override the negativity that you experience there.free snacks in break room, most offices are located in nice areasshort breaks if they let you take one, crude patients and staff, will overwork and underpay, will make it hard to approve PTO and call in sick, sick time and vacation are the sameToxic pandering, unkindOne Medical as an ideal is phenomenal but as a practice bad. They really are a corporation who only cares their bottom line they want an award for doing the bare minimum. They are grossly disconnected from black people and ostracized thier POC employees.Free lunch for the google siteRacism, favoritism, seniority over merit, classism, gaslighting.an awful place to workthe adminstrative assistants are over worked and severely under paid (one medical should be ashamed of the wages that they pay the admin assistants) this is a place for young people with no work experience. some mangers should be in a management class called ""management for dummies"".medical, dental and vision benefitseverything elseAwful ManagementThis place doesn’t value employees, treats them like a number. Management is basically a bunch of former retail managers who know nothing about the medical industry. Admins are regularly tasked with diffusing issues with billing even though they are given no training. Would not suggest working here at all costs.Not valued by leadershipThe administrative role is not valued by leadership in any capacity. Changes in our job descriptions or website that we depended on were frequently made without consulting any admins. Some of the changes make it physically impossible to do our jobs. It also put stress on our IT team to put out fires at the last minute because they are trying to fix the issues caused by the changes.They preach a feedback culture but feedback never travels more than 2 levels of seniority above you. Upper management cares about keeping investors happy, not the admins who are keeping the company afloat.This also applies to safety; our pleas for PPE in offices and and hazard pay in COVID testing tents went unheeded. Still, they are expecting admins in the office to take on additional roles and responsibilities without having their safety concerns addressed. You just feel very helpless in this role, as there is seemingly nothing you can do that will make leadership care about you.Great benefits, amazing team members (on the ground)All of upper management, complete disregard of admins and their safetyOk place to work, startup vibe is not for meWorked here several years ago. It was alright. At the time, management seemed inexperienced and lacked managerial skill; it may be different now as it’s been a few years. That said, I loved most of my coworkers—the coworkers made the job enjoyable even when the work itself tended to be on the boring side. When I was there the company also felt like a startup, which I’ve learned was not for me.Creative, fun coworkersBoring, repetitive work, inexperienced managers.Enjoyable experienceOverall, I have learned a great many new things and meet wonderful people to work with.There is always some way to grow and learn and experience new things.Free SnacksWorkflow can change overnightNice opportunity to learn more about administrative workflows but not great for long-term career.Work-life balanceWork-life balance at One Medical is somewhat okay NOT the best. You would learn the ropes that works best for you and you will be ok.Unestablished company, unfair pay, incompetent managementUnestablished company with young, Inexperienced, incompetent and unsupportive management and a strange culture that encourages Flattery and forced and fake friendship.Phlebotomists are the most underrepresented group worked the most, asked to clean the restrooms, mistreated and bossed by admins and paid the least.Insane workload and unfair pay.Specimen handling is not OSHA compliant, skills and clinical care is not the center of attention.Work environment is hostile, unwelcoming and unhealthy. Harassment, favoritisms and bullying going on.Inaccessible, uninvolved HR.No advancement opportunities, No transfer opportunities, no annual raises.If you are knowledgeable and experienced Don’t settle for this less.Paid holidaysEverything elseJob LifeI gave it 2 stars because my Manager is nice. But this job is VERY overwhelming and the pay should be better. Job show favoritism. The job disruption when applying is not all you will be doing, you be doing so much sometimes it make your head spin.bad mixed with goodLet me start off by saying I loved my city's immediate and coworkers. I'll get all the good stuff out first. Managers are extremely nice and caring especially considering how much they endure themselves. My manager/coworkers and I were extremely close to the point where you would think we were brothers/sisters/aunts/uncles based on our playful fights and arguments. Many people actively hang out with each other outside of work. The providers (nurses, doctors, PAs, etc) are extremely nice as well and don't feel the need to throw around their titles. Both managers and doctors (at least in my experience) actively listen to suggestions and solutions from admin. Company rewards you for just about anything, but in the payment of food and small offices parties. There are opportunities for growth and even movement into other sectors of the company. You also have the ability to work from other offices around the country. The office culture is super relaxed, but not to the point where it affects how the office is run nor patient care. You learn a lot about patient care and yourself. This is a great post graduation job or getting a feel for the medical field. It definitely helped me realize my short and long term career goals, especially since I didn't see myself working for them for the rest of my life. I will say it is hard to get fired from company unless you are just not doing anything at all. They meet you where you're at and help you in areas that you're lacking in. I was trained for a decent amount of time, but I've seen them just throw employees into the role. Luckily, like I saidoffice parties, ability to work from different offices, relaxed office settingPay rate, overworked staff, rude staff, bad/outdated trainingToo much to live up toThere are a lot of expectations, which puts an exuberant amount of pressure on your mental mind space. Hard to finish work and not reflect on the struggle you just experienced for 8 hours, and the struggle your up against for the next day. Lovely co-workers and managers, but admins and management need more support.Great company with a great futurePeople really focus in the ultimate goal which is to provide great primary care for all whether your job is directly with patients or not. Overall very open to hear feedback and take actions for improvements.Collaboration between depts, no co-pay for One Medical visits"
"ESRI, Inc.","Good people with some challenges to sort throughGreat product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year.Ups and DownsWorking as a support analyst can be a little rough sometimes and it doesn't help that support services has such a large turnover rate. With the amount of work we do, pay isn't competitive.Benefits, banked hours, remoteLower pay, high turnoverOkay Starting JobInitially seemed like a good company, but as time has gone on has become stagnant. It is very tough to advance and is a slow process. Requires several approvals and numerous interviews to possibly not be selected. Pay is low and was brought to management’s attention and nothing has been done. As an enterprise analyst, you’re required to have large skill set compared to desktop or online teams, but aren’t compensated. Good benefits but it doesn’t make up for pay. It is a good way to start your career but wouldn’t suggest as a long term career moveBad ManagementThe company is great but there is no transparency in the salary, hiring process, and management. They should spend more time and money on keeping the current workers.Esri: buyer bewareAfter working with Esri 4+ years, it’s clear to me that they prioritize people who work more than 40 hrs/week and would be very Esri loyal. There is little sense of structure in terms of when a person is up for advancement, even though they have defined career lattices for each arena within the division. Comparative pay is lower for the industry although benefits are generally good overall. Previous employees were silenced or pushed out for wanting to make serious and needed change to the way corporate handles housing and pay. Too much of the decisions on direction are decided at the top executive level.Good option for work/life balance, but falls short in career advancement and payOffers great work/life balance with ample opportunities for learning and personal development. In product development, you can shape the direction of your career to an extent; however, career advancement can be slow given the flat company structure. Coworkers are great for the most part, although known troublemakers are tolerated without consequences, or simply shuffled from team to team. Middle management is pulled mostly from long-time employees, regardless of leadership qualities. Company culture has declined over the past few years, with complacency setting in. This, along with below-industry pay seems to drive talented and motivated people elsewhere. Despite this, it's a good place to start your career and offers good work/life balance.Work/life balance; flexibility; learning opportunitiesLeadership; career development; below industry pay4 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Overall, a very good company for people who want a stable income and are not ambitious in their career path. Good job security and no layoff because Jack is a kind guy; good medical and dental package; yearly pre-tax bonus deposited to 401K; work/life balance; inexpensive living cost in the cheap surrounding citiesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?An Esri employee is paid by hours. So how to get hours from manager is critical. You can get more and easy hours if you are manager's favorite. Otherwise, your work will be miserableWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very rare opportunity for career growth so peers' competition is low; as result, the relation among co-workers is friendlyWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Depending which department you are in. You are very relaxed and can spend most of your day walking around on the company's campus if you are in the core product (ArcGIS) department; you feel anxious most time to look for approved hours from your manager if you are in the professional services department.Adaptive and HarmonyThe management is willing to listen to staff request and make the adjustment accordingly. If you looking to learn more things, this is a good place to go with and expecting brain cracking process in this company as the product is a bit complicated (this is science). Overall, working in this company can be stressful, but a lot exposure given for you. Blessed to be part of Esri Malaysia team!Great relationshipsWould work there anytime. Esri has a great people who are committed to making Esri better everyday and helping its customers succeed in what they do.starting this job remotely is difficultSucceeding in this company as a support analyst is dependent on work collaboration or having prior knowledge of GIS systems. Not enough constructive criticismGreat job security, although at a cost.Esri provides amazing job security. It's well known that the company doesn't do layoffs. This speaks volumes about their business model.First of all, they do well. They have secured many government contracts and worked their data into many large companies. Secondly, they advertise their stability to attract candidates. That's what brought me in there. I mean, no layoffs and a steady job until retirement for many sounds amazing. And at first, it sounded amazing to me too.With no layoffs, the company never trims the dead weight. The dead weight the company has acquired over the years sits in middle management for the most part. As a whole, the company is very behind the curve. They are the premiere GIS company, although there are many players now in their space really impacting their business. While people are passionate about GIS, they aren't very innovative when it comes to technology outside of the GIS space.So if you're a GIS person, then Esri is probably a great place to hang things up, boast about how great ArcGIS is, and count the hours until you retire. Although if you aspire to work in cutting edge technology and surround yourself with people that are looking to do innovative things, then I'd think twice before signing up there. They move very very slow. Like a snail.Lots of meetings, then more meetings, then missing deadlines. If you're lazy, then it's a great place for you. I personally found this environment torture, and after a few years, I couldn't wait to get away and start doing some good work again.Anyhow - the Esri mission isStability. They don't lay people off.Out of touch upper management, lazy people, lots of incompetence, and generally a very slow pace, and Redlands.Poor Communication/HR/ModernizationEsri is a very successful company, that offers a lot of job stability. However, healthcare benefits should not justify the low pay to most of the employees. Esri seems to be stuck in the 80's and justifies its compensation based on benefits. Additionally, if the company needs to look to restructure and work on one department they truly need help in HR. Esri HR is not ethical, helpful, communicative, and truly is a huge underlying cause for employees leaving and not wanting to transfer internally.Good place to learnEsri is a good place to start your career in IT. There are respectful employees so you get treated well. It is easy to move to other teams and you get opportunities to do that.Not equal opportunity employerThis company from ownership down think poorly of non college educated staff. It is known that non exempt staff are not valued. Have given exempt staff FULL FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES and communicated for 2yrs this would be for everyone until recently. They are not giving and flexibility or hybrid schedules to non exempt staff and are having a mass exodus over it but hasnt even given them pause to reconsider. Hundreds of employees that have been with company for 10+ years are being treated so poorly and extremely under paid. Do not recommend this company. Not what you think. The benefits are great but they hold it over you once you relocate to area and pay extremely low. People openly talk politics and HR does not protect people of different opinions.Enjoyable workDiscrimination, not progressive in improving processesGreat place to work- amazing culture truly embodying work / life harmony, diversity and inclusion- developing incredible cutting edge technology software products- amazing company to work forGreat place to learn twch skillsAwesome place to work and learn tech skills for new grads. There is a lot to learn and everyone is helpful. If you enjoy helping others and troubleshooting this is for youTech skills, work atmosphereToo many cases, training too shortA very inclusive environment that encourages innovationIt's a great company. Innovative, creative, and inclusive. The campus also has an aesthetic that encourages one to find new solutions, to create new ideas, and think outside of the box.Great cafe on campusNo advancement if you don't have a degreeOverall, a good placeIf you value stability over change and security over frequent advancement, then Esri is a great place to work. If you are looking for a fast-paced, agile work environment, you may be disappointed. With a very conservative financial approach and slow-moving decision making processes, Esri is great for employees looking to onboard and spend considerable time in their hired positions.Workplace culture is nicely middle-of-the-road, neither dogmatic nor ignored. Most staff are friendly and helpful.Good healthcare plan with no monthly employee premium.May be too slow moving for those looking to advance quickly.CollaborationEsri prides itself on teams working together to achieve their goals. Like with any company, once you become accustomed to the way things work, it becomes easier to communicate with other departments and build up your professional and personal skills.A great place to workA great place to work if you land the role you want.You can learn to your heart's content. Salary is ok and benefits are good. You can develop your career in different direction.Great working atmosphere; access to latest GIS knowledge; Career advancement; Good benefitsSalary is industry standard (not really a con)Amazing people making a difference together!Esri is the best place I have ever worked and I have been in the Geospatial industry for a very long time. I have never worked anywhere that had so many intelligent people with great senses of humor in one place. The Pacific Northwest team is the best!Good people with some challenges to sort throughGreat product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year.Great place for a careerThis is absolutely a fantastic organization for the rest of my career. This company takes care of its employees providing fair pay and adequate time off.Pay, vacationAmazinging superior environment with many v. smart people - supportive colleagues - great managementI spent an interval of time at this extraordinary company - learned so much every day - was given opportunity for advancementstremendously sound leadershipability to hone skills in an exceptionally positive environment - Esri is a suburb corporate citizenBest place I’ve ever worked!Esri is by far one of the best places I’ve ever worked. Management is extremely supportive and clearly wants to see their employees succeed. Esri has a clear mission to help change the world through advancing spatial science, and they are doing a great job of it.Paid hourly, but still exempt. Earning potential is larger then 40 hours.None so farControlling senior managementIt’s difficult to get things done effectively and efficiently. There were inept senior leaders who did not create processes that made it clear how to get things done. Zero creativity. All about repeating what had been done before — no matter how ineffective it was. Ten approvals just to buy a customer lunch. Incredible lack of trust in the people they hire. The micromanagement was intense.High TurnoverMy experience here was unfortunately bad and felt obligated to share my experience as it is all too common. During my time at ESRI, I had no support from management as my supervisor intimidated and belittled me everyday. I was told I disposable daily, it got so bad I didn't know if Id get paid for a full day work. I was told from HR & management to either take it or leave. Management doesn't care about your career aspirations and there is little to any movement/promotions. There is high turn over, don't expect to work here and for things to be fair. Interns are paid more than those with more experience. Non-exempt employees are treated as second class. Working hard isn't good enough here to make it. The company has a reputation for ""spitting out"" those who don't quite fit. I've spoken to many people around the community who have had similar negative experiences. Most people do not end up making it long term, so don't be fooled by the fact that people have worked there for years. If you end up working here know that you are taking a risk, it could possibly and will most likely NOT work. I would consider this company to be more of a bridge job rather than a career. The job itself was easy but the culture was one of complaints, gossip, and unfriendly colleagues. It sucked the life out of many people and it affected their performance/moral. Inconsistent and malicious management/supervisors doesn't allow you to focus on your craft. Leaving this company was the best decision I could of made. Avoid this company due to the fact that it has HIGH turnover, malicious management, low pay,Poor experienceWorked in one of ""Support Centres"". Had to leave it much earlier.Key points:1. All management is mostly of one race and mentality, there is no diversity whatsoever2. Roads are not open to smart, but to loyal people with no backbone3. So called ""leads"" are in fact mini-directors, they lead nothing apart from tucking people back in the line4. Caste society. Double-speaking, double and triple-dealing mass, which covers up for one another and never progresses because of that. Very narrow-minded people.5. Rude and often incompetent ""leaders"", ""trainers"".6. Misleading and even threatening management which has no idea what GIS is.7. Terrible treatment in overall. Place is soaked in lies, manipulations and gossips. Tons of politics. Everyone who is upper is never accountable.8. Management does not care about anything as long as workers are loyal and useful. One can drink beer and play Fortnite at work, second would be fired in 24 hours if dares to ask for days off to take care of their child.9. Meaningless to say, but all the rules are applied selectively. It depends on how much one can lick.free lunchesmanagementWorked at ESRI for 24 years from 1984.I would not recommend this company other than to use it as a jump start to somewhere better. Believe, there are way better places to forward your career. Everyone thinks that Jack Dangermonds company is the best. In the 1980's and 90's it was a great place to work. But as soon as they had TWO HR departments monitoring your email calling you in to HR because it too more than 15 minutes to respond while you were at lunch or in the bathroom. That is when I left after 24 years. I Have my own business now and love it. I have to say it has been very tough since March 2020. But we are all suffering from the same thing.nonot reallyProductiveProductive and efficient work environment. A typical day at work was repetitive and balanced. The workplace culture was sufficient. The hardest part of the job was finding coverage for the front desk.Friendly work environment both demands and rewards adaptability.The hardest part of the job was simply settling into the environment and learning the new tools. After that, I was set to work. I would experience problems and difficulties with the projects, but I always had someone else's expertise to rely on. After a while, others would even come to me for help on their project. I was always learning new things (even an entirely new programming language on the spot), so there wasn't any shortage of challenge, but even during my rougher patches where I struggled more than I'd liked, I still felt like an appreciated part of the team.The only complaint about the job was the commute time (40 mins there, 50 mins back), but that was primarily a personal problem.Good culture, wide variety of challengesCommute timeGreat products and people.Esri is a leader in the industry not only because it started so long ago, but because as a privately owned company, it reinvests profits back into it's people, products and services. There is always a clear mission to help people understand their world with the technology.Opportunity for Professional GrowthEsri provides many opportunities for personal and professional growth. You are given ample training opportunities to define your own direction and contribution to the the team / organization.You are free to do what you wantWorked at Esri ~3 years. A typical day is really dependent on you. I spend a lot of time researching and learning in addition to normal job responsibilities. Management is very hands off. Very open culture.Most frustrating part are difficult employees who have been here forever and are just coasting.loved this environment. I was allowed to plan multiple extra curriculum activities that brought the team closer.A typical day at Esri would be exciting as i got the chance to make my day whatever it needed to be above and beyond my normal work duties. Be it a candy bar station, fresh flowers or a birthday celebration it was always something to bring a lighter part of these heavy hitters day.Management was great towards these activities, but unfortunately, not towards promoting us. Management was like our friend but was not secure enough in their position to make things happen for their staff. This would be the hardest part of the job. As I watched so many educated and skilled young people stay on the same level for so long.But what I will remember most of Esri is the awesome support I received from Everyone when my husband got sick and during his last 2 1/2 years of life Esri was there for me like no other. I never was made to feel bad about time off and my team did everything they would to ensure my work continued in my absence. I will never forget...Enjoyed my time with ESRIThe ESRI culture is a strong one of individual accountability and success. One big thing to note for sales positions is that this is a non-commission sales organization. They pay fairly, but the big upside swings are not available.Company stuck in the pastLot of old school programmers who bog down the company. They keep hearkening back to past and show little respect for new employees. I see a lot of toxic shouting matches and hazing which new employees have to endure. Also a lot of rules such as vacation hours and remote work are applied selectively. Old employees are on vacation but dont use their hours, because selective bias+magic. Being an industry leader does not guarantee the same forever. Drive long time toxic employees out.Challenging CultureEsri software is by far the best GIS software on the market unfortunately it is a very difficult culture to work in. The organization is flat and advancement is only provided to a select few of inner circle of managers. Partnering with Esri is also very difficult. The Partners often complain about the length of time it takes to achieve closure on issues and opportunities due to the bureaucracy at the corporate levelGood work-life balanceBeatiful working environments and lots of independent office cells. Employees can trade extra working time for vacations. I guess that’s why the salary is not that high.I don't recommend to people I care aboutI didn't feel respected, or valued after working there for a long time. Career advancement was impossible, no help by managers or HR. I could never trust my direct managers. Esri has this, ""need to have a degree to work here"" mentality so this place is filled with, new grads, or old experienced professionals. Because of that, you have a whole lot of spoon fed arrogant people with no creativity, lack of social skills, vision, life experience, passion or care about what they really want to do with their lives. If you are creative, fun, have true passion for what you do, got your degree by really working for it, go somewhere fun like NBC Universal, Disney, Google, places like that. Fair warned.It was fineI would rather not comment on my time there but to be honest I think the company is growing every day and it's still being run with a small business mentality. That can be good socially, but also make's it very hard to grow professionally.What I learnedAs a Jr. Systems admin, I got to learn a lot of new things from my Colleagues. I also learned some better ways of performing tasks that I had existing knowledge of in a much quicker wayGood people with some challenges to sort throughGreat product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year.Winds of change are blowing at EsriAverage pay, terrific benefits package. Sales organization can be stressful despite non-commissioned sales force; experiences vary considerably by manager. Markedly different experiences and work-life balance across divisions. Little to no promotional opportunities in the remote offices. Management bottlenecks make it hard to get business done. Work is underway to modernize much of Esri in IT and Bus Dev for example, more needs to be done as other Bus units seem stuck decades behind. Company culture shifting with growth; businesslike climate is being replaced with a more social atmosphere - can be frustrating to observe some enjoy the levity while seasoned staff carry the load.31Great place to workEsri cares about its employees and its customers. Everyone is passionate and mission focused. The CEO and founder has integrity and is a good organizational leader.1Great job with amazing benefitsGreat people, amazing support team in place and the benefits that are provided are so amazing. The work environment is very team oriented...great place to work.Great Place but Management is a bit too stuck in the pastGreat place to work hours are not bad, the pay is okay, and benefits are great, however (I can't speak entirely for Esri) I guess I just got unlucky to be placed in a really strict management and work environment. Some people you may run across are a tad bit passive but that just how they are. They are definitely experiencing a HUGE age gap (not a lot of young folks) and I just feel like it's because of management. They are really stuck in the past and things like ""warming the seat"" are somethings you have to get use to. Although it's a tech company just beware of how traditional management is.On my way outI have spent many hours learning new skills, made myself clear to management and HR about what my passions are, and what I want to do in the future. I certified myself in the new skill, and continued educating myself by attending school and made sure I was learning skills to help my current department and future position.This all went nowhere. I felt management and HR turned the other way, never encouraged and applauded my non-stop drive to learn and advance. I felt esri would rather hire peon interns and outsiders instead of focusing on the people that have dedicated themselves long term.I WAS happy go lucky, excited to advance and impress my colleagues, and be awesome for esri. Instead, with the constant cold shoulders of my leaders that enjoys the focus on minute failings, my goals were to learn what I need to learn, educate myself, and hash out of esri and never turn back. I am very keen, educated, fun, and drive to succeed. The company that knows how to recognize this will be extremely, and pleasantly happy.Great place to work with great benefitsBeing a worldwide company, it was an exciting place to work. I was able to see parts of world I never would visited and work with great people. Great accessibility to different cultures.A Typical Day at WorkClerical work with review of the paperwork. Additional review followed by clerical work. Seldom any interaction with the outside world. This is a government contractor.Flexible HoursInexperienced ManagementFun work environment and great to learn new skillsI enjoyed my time at Esri. I got to learn many new GIS skills that I would not have anywhere else. The people are great to work with and will always help you.Do not recommend EsriMy experience at Esri was very negative. I often had very little work during the week to do and when I brought this to the attention of my supervisor, he retaliated. When I took a medical leave of absence, he tanked my review and took away my work. When I returned after months of working with HR to resolve the differences between myself and my supervisor, I was asked to resign. When I refused to resign, they came back with a very small severance package to entice me to walk away amicably.Opportunity to travel and learn GIS softwarePoor management and HR practices.laidback environment for most roles. Job securityVery low pay in the industry. New hires even fresh grad got paid more than expirenced employees. No room for career advancements too. They are very good in sponsoring H1b visa and green card for international employees. If you have other job offers, do not take this one. My team is famous to grow algorithm programmers for other big tech companies which is sad.Flexible hoursLow payFun workplace and unique workAt the icon and design division, we were given unique projects to design for different clients within Esri and also develop products to better the company in general. I learned how to utilize Illustrator to its full potential and tested my limits in problem-solving while learning it. The culture is overall welcoming and encouraging, getting help and critique from other departments and creators are encouraged, which was the most enjoyable aspect of the internship. The most difficult part was working without tools that full-time employees had access to, but in the end, the challenge helped me learn even more.The schedule is very customizable to work with commuting and other events later or earlier in the day. Throughout a work day, I'd work on my assigned project and do check-ins regularly with my project leaders to make sure my designs were on schedule and within the guidelines.Coworkers, projects, schedulingFrequent project changesTeam work atmosphereOne of the hardest most demanding projects that i have worked but the experience was priceless. During a flood like harvey caused the entire region was in chaos and the people treated us like heroesPaid for food and lodgingSome workers and staff were in experiencedSales associateA typical day involves fielding telephone calls, producing quotes, and providing information to clients about business-to-business software. Workplace culture is relaxed and the management hierarchy is perceived to be flat (no org charts). The company hires former government employees to build their sales contacts and offers no compensation for increased software sales.Esri ExperienceOverall Esri is a great company to work for that encourages all employees to learn and use their products to better serve their customer base and find innovative solutions.Travel reimbursement, banked hours, great benefitsGreat company with a horrible sales channelGreat company with a solid mission to be a source for good in the world. However the internal conflicts between product leaders, and a long history or bad marketing left them struggling to be accessible to a larger audience. The company has much much much smaller footprint than they deserve.Great mission, Great peopletoo self-centered, lateral moves almost impossibleAvoid this CompanyVery negative experience with this company. Non-exempt staff are treated poorly and work/life balance is only for exempt employees. Two classes of employees here. Management do not trust staff and over-control minutia. They are out-of-touch with modern work practices and make it difficult to get simple things done. Dead-end company.Free coffeeManagementGreat place to workI really enjoy my work here at Esri.

Epic,"Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price.Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one.If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you.Limited room for growth and insane onboardingOne thing about Epic that people should know going in, especially young professionals hoping to make friends at work, is that Epic makes it really hard to do so by absolutely overloading you during the onboarding process. In addition, once you actually have time to chat with people, work becomes your top priority.You are expected to log time down to the 15 minute interval, and lunch does not count towards your minimum 8 hours a day. The expectation is that you put more than 40 hours a week into work.It is clear that some positions at the company are viewed as more important than others (this is reflected in your pay).The interview process was a convoluted mess, and I was switched into a role with significantly lower pay near the end of the process.With the average tenure of employees only being around 3 years, it makes sense that I just got here and I am already thinking of leaving. If people can't see a future there for more than 3 years, then there probably isn't a future for me here either.Software Developer InternThe internship is done in three stages, Design, Development, and Testing (somewhat). The duration of these is split up into 3-4 weeks periods that all interns normally hit.Pretty terrible management!Pay is good, everything else is terrible. Everyone works overtime. I think the management is greedy with these huge piles of money they're making and , it seems, not giving much of anything back to the community!Any other big tech company.You get what you’d expect from a constantly growing 12000+ employee company in tech. Epic will give you:1) A decent (QM) to good (TS, IS, SD) salary2) Some experience for your resume right out of college3) Stability, and good benefitsBut they will also:1) Expect you to be available for beyond standard hours pretty consistently2) Give no flexibility on being in the office because they spend so much money building all these offices so why would they give WFH to long-standing (or any) employees?3) Refuse to deal with a significant turnover rate issue which stresses current employees to the max4) Not give many opportunities for significant advancement aside from becoming a Team Lead or switching teams/rolesUltimately, some people swear by Epic and buy into the culture, so it’s up to you if the pros outweigh the cons. But seriously consider, if you can, taking more time to search elsewhere and understanding if this is a job you’re willing to take on.Good food, (95%) good coworkers, events/clubs for employeesWill work you as much as you let them, your opinions don’t matter, you’re just another dog in their machineAlright for the First Job Out of CollegePros:- Many young people straight out of college, which generates a youthful atmosphere.- Campus is nice-looking.- Cafeteria with good food.- Pay is good.Cons:- Few people stay for long (more than three years), at least in my role.- Work-life balance is not very good. Generally, more and more tasks are shoved into you.- My manager doesn't seem to care much about my side of the argument. He seems to trust every tattle-taler over me.- Very few transferable skills other than working with customers (which is very frequent).EpicGood place to work while you look for another job. Cool campus and used to have good food, so I bet it will again. The software is really boring and the company sense of humor is corny and not in a good way.Maybe okay for a first job, but poor work life balance and burn outEpic's workforce is based mainly on hiring recent grads fresh out of college that are eager to get into the workforce and want to contribute. Many haven't developed the skills to set good work boundaries and feel pressured to work extra hours to keep up with the endless amount of work.Coworkers are great and the pay is good, but expect your coworkers to be constantly burnt out.They call it a software factory because management runs it like you're a factory workerPros: Amazing pay, the best health insurance you will ever have, great food, and a good start to your career if you want to leave and pivot with the experience you have been trusted with. Despite the cons, it is an excellent career stepping stone.Cons: Incredibly old fashioned ideas about work that do not work well in a 21st century company. Especially a tech company.Not a lot of time off, laughably bad WFH - 5 full days a year, and it is difficult to trust management - they botched the COVID response by recklessly endangering lives pre-vaccine through trying to force a return to office until the local health department had to step in and stop them - and they consistently mislead employees to this day.Hemorrhaging tenured talent due to terrible management decisions, like limited WFH. The exodus of experience is causing extra work for all at the company who stay. They are trying to hire their way out of it but the tenured staff that knows stuff is leaving.Also, there's no real great culture at Epic. They really talk up the culture when you are interviewing, but the culture itself is barely there. You have people huddled in their offices all day not talking to each other. It is just not a fun company or environment once you get over the fun campus design. Instead of being a fun, bustling, culture-filled environment, it is instead the kind of place where you dread bumping into the person across the hall because you have never gotten to know them well since you are isolated in your window-less private office all day just punching in for your shift at the software factory.Pay, Benefits, Amazing Health Insurance, good stepping stoneNo WFH, workload, lack of culture, isolation in your private office, and management is the worstCome for the pay and benefits, stay for the non-competeFun and challenging work at a cool campus with great food, pay and benefits. Coworkers are great, but management is out of touch and there is no transparency. They are so irrationally dedicated to on-site work only that they tried to bring everyone back to the office mid-pandemic, ignoring thousands of people's complaints and a public health order. They are chronically understaffed. Work/life balance is very difficult. Workload is unsustainable. Non-compete makes it hard to leave and find work elsewhere that leverages your skills and experience.Good starting jobThis job is a good starting job for when you come out of college since you get paid very well and you get pretty good training in the role you will be working in but its not the best work-life balance at time and no flexibility on work from home.OkIt's mostly fine, though there is a bit of a culture to really enjoy your work and work more than what is asked of you. I like to keep my work and personal life separate and this is a little bit harder to do.nice placecool place, a lot of training at the beginning. big community. decent pay considering the location. you might have to work with technology that isn't commonly used elsewhere.Good Job for just starting out of collegeIt is a well paying job right out of college, but having no flexibility with remote work was definitely a turn off plus at times work was very stressful with the deadlines.Good job right out of college. No one stays long.Not a bad place to start off but not a good place to stay long term. They lure you in with the promise of sabbatical but barely anyone can last 5 years.Good payNo work from homeCompany is awesome, Managers could be betterHaving been trained by the owner of the company I knew what she wanted and how it should be done. She cared about people and growing them. New managers over the growth of the company did not share this idealism would play favorites and have their own goals in mind and not the companies. Do good and work hard and you are rewarded in a nut shell.Health Care cost were really low due to average age of company. Stocks.Self absorbed managersEpic has a great mission but terrible approach to treating employeesWorking at Epic was terrible personally, but I do know of people who genuinely enjoy or at least tolerate it. So here’s a fair assessment of what Epic does well:- Mission: Epic software is world class. While it is definitely not the most user-friendly, it is the entrenched market leader and that’s unlikely to change. Expect relative stability and no layoffs as a result.- Pay: There’s no denying a $65k starting salary for a job with no tech background required is pretty great. Many liberal arts, music, soft majors can get hired and excel. I know of several people who are very wealthy in their mid-20s because of Epic. IF you survive, though.- Hiring via tests over personality/connections: This is also a huge pro. Epic is entirely meritocratic in their hiring and this is quite admirable in theory. You work with co-workers who went to prestigious universities and state schools in Iowa; Epic doesn’t care. There are some consequences to that in some interesting personalities getting hired and becoming emotionally unintelligent TLs.- Training: Training focuses heavily on understanding the system. After a few weeks, you’ll emerge with several Epic certs for free that you can take elsewhere after the non-compete ends.- Colleagues: All my colleagues were smart. Business smart? Not really. But they were smart and could figure out problems. Any low performers are generally weeded out before even being extended an offer.Cons...Where do I even begin? Look up signs of a toxic workplace and compare it to your time at Epic. Think VERY carefully about the risk you are aboutGood salary, cheap COL, no experience neededRidiculous hours, emotionally unintelligent management, random app assignment leads to potential chaoscool job on paper, extremely disappointing to work forTLDR: My experience with Epic was terrible but it’s more dependent on what work is being pushed on you. There are some great aspects to the job but many downsides as well. You should at least skim this for content important to you.Working at Epic may be one of the biggest risks in your career. They target enthusiastic college graduates to fill positions with many responsibilities and, what initially seems like, very rewarding compensation. The average Epic worker stays for 2 years. This is around the time most people realize their job takes more from you than it gives. Epic will overload you with work until you are burnt out. Once you leave, Epic will be of no help to you real quick.As an integration engineer (EDI), you may do 1. tech support (A.k.a. “TS” or “Technical Services”), 2. software implementation, 3. software development, and 4. miscellaneous internal ownership, all for interfaces and APIs. In my time there, I’ve had to do all 4 options.1. The TS portion of the job may be hit or miss, depending on you you’re supporting and what other software they plan on integrating with. My customers put too much reliance on me, putting me in a permanent overwhelmed state. You will not travel to your TS customers; which makes up the majority of your customer base in case this was of interest to you.2. The implementation portion was my most rewarding part. In this role, you help a hospital system implement Epic software for the first time. Unlike all other roles in the job, you can build directly in the customer’s to-be-implemented system. However, it requires the most effortgreat culunary team, good entry-level pay, some roles may allow travelterrible work/life balance, they don't care about you as an individual, little growth, risk in finding your careerToxic work environmentI worked at Epic a few years ago. While there are a few perks of working at Epic, the negatives vastly outweigh them. This was my experience: During the hiring process, I only met with HR and other employees (and they're not necessarily the same people you're going to be working with). I learned who my TL/manager was on my first day. Though I worked hard and tried my best to be agreeable, my manager hated me for some reason. Needless to say, it's hard to be happy and successful at work when your own manager is unsupportive and has no sense of fairness and decency. I also had a couple backstabbing, two-faced coworkers who threw me under the bus for their own personal gain. Fun times.At any rate, I think people's experiences at Epic depend heavily on which team you're on and which TL you have.Nice and interesting campus, excellent food, free garage parkingWork-life balance, lack of proper leadershipCULTure is a problemThey will give you as much work as they can unless you object. 55 hour work weeks are normal and if you end up working an 80 hour week nobody would even ask you if you needed assistance. Management's response to COVID was irresponsible -- it took anonymous employees going to the press media to have Epic reverse its decision to have us all come back into the office in Aug 2020 because "" we were losing out on our culture, big time"".Developers, QAer, TS, are all overworked.FoodCULTureLittle Support while Training; Cult-likeNot much support during the training period after the initial ""classes."" Often very difficult to find anyone who had any time to answer questions so wasted a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to fix/solve things myself. Didn't really enjoy being herded into a massive auditorium every month with 10,000 other people, either. I understand that it was supposed to foster a feeling of unity, but I always felt like cattle. I also worried about what would happen if there was any kind of emergency in the room, as people wouldn't be able to get out quickly at all. The overall feel of the place was somewhat cult-ish to me. My personality wasn't a match for the company culture and I was very unhappy there.Interesting campus, cafeteria food was goodLack of support, cult-like feel, stressfulGreat comp, benefits, advancement - at a price.Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one.If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you.QA, Covid, and much moreIn QA, most of my time was spent just testing software which can be tedious but also rewarding if you are a very detail-oriented person. If you genuinely like to critique, you may like this job. At Epic, you will also be encouraged to seek out extra projects. Fair warning, you will likely be expected to still complete a full load of your main job like testing while also being expected to complete this project and they don't factor as much into pay. For QA, nearly all of your pay will be determined by how you rank compared to other QAers which means that if you work with a good developer you could make less than someone who is working just as hard and as well as you. You cannot talk to anyone about pay because it is against policy and there is not really a tangible department to talk to.In terms of Covid, work from home was strongly discouraged because it would affect the culture. Epic made the news and only after media push did it seem like policies got better. Seriously, check out Epic Covid response. Working there when covid started, I saw that lack of people working there/lack of resources resulted in a lot of development getting pushed back and that development that should have been fixed years ago ended up causing a lot of problems for customers when covid hit. Management did not push back unnecessary development with the influx of new needed covid development. Instead, they made it seem to us like we were to blame for it even when everyone (QA and Developers at the very least) were working insane hours. A lot of problems I had with my manager were that theyCool campus, green campus, mostly everyone is early twenties so you can find some friendsYou will be working more than 40 hours a week and way above if IS or TS, for QA there is little career advancement, cannot speak to anyone about pay7Challenging workplace in declineWorking with customers can be challenging but funTechnical issues are interesting but specific to Epic softwareExposed to a variety of responsibilities, from working with analyst teams, to brainstorming with executives, or leading initiatives for process changesRelatively flexible work schedule, as long as 40+ hours are logged every weekMost colleagues are happy to help out, even when the customer isn't theirsNature, quality and quantity of work is very application/manager specificManagers don't seem to hold power to change the day-to-day of their team members, decisions made at the top are absoluteCOVID response was abysmal and disappointingGreat cafeteria, individual offices (1-2 people per room), challenging problems to solve, freedom to complete work or pursue professional interests, variety of tasks to completeLittle PTO, relocation fee repayment if leaving w/in 2 years, non-compete (18 months now but can be extended at any time), pay and healthcare is good, but other benefits are mediocre at best, increasingly bureaucratic11Fulfilling work but unrealistic workloadYou do meaningful work and the pay is good, but there is high stress and workload that comes with your role that can unrealistic at times. The company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also been very poor, with resistance to WFH policies and repeated efforts to bring all staff back to campus when not necessary.Meaningful work, beautiful campus, good food, fun coworkers, great compensationPoor work-life balance, poor COVID response, large workloadEntry level -- not meant for career (unless you lack a soul)The biggest concern is the gap between official policy and what is actually done. It is very disharmonious to be constantly guessing which way to go on anything. You are supposed to advocate for the customer, put yourself in their shoes etc, but management loved to leave you hanging as you are taking the fire for it. While the pay is decent, it isn't worth the stress at all. Additionally, the older the company gets, the more disconnected it gets with customers. The software is very expensive. At this point, they should be focusing on cost reductions. Healthcare costs continue to go up faster than inflation. You also have managers who get away with treating others on the team like dirt (like forcing you to cancel vacation plans and go to an install on the first flight out of Madison on a Saturday morning to pull an overnight shift that same night).your own officeridiculous work weeks, vacation, managementGreat start to a careerEpic will make you work hard, but you will learn a lot, and get a head start on your peers. 5 years at Epic is worth 15 elsewhere. If you aren't afraid to work hard, think critically, and embrace success under independence, this job can be a good fit.Hit or Miss IT / Project Management jobDepending on your app, role, and boss, this job can be very rewarding or somewhat demoralizing, very relaxed or somewhat overwhelming. Work load for me and many others regularly exceeded 60 hrs/wk with occasional weekends on call, but for some was typically 45-50 and relaxed. Fairly flat management structure means your boss will know and understand your job, but may not have many management skills. Typical day is spent making calls with analysts using Epic Software and troubleshooting code and implementation. Stay away from Clinical Documentation and Ambulatory roles if possible.Demanding but rewarding if you can see a project to completionIt's a competitive environment with lots of people trying their best to stand out in a crowd. As a result, you'll get to work with a bunch of highly motivated individuals all eager to help out. On the flip side, I feel that if you want to achieve a good work-life balance it can be challenging - it will really force you to be a good manager of your self. Some times the job can seem overly bureaucratic too - tons of red tape that I've ran into here. But I suppose that's expected when you're working with health data. Overall, I'd say that it's a good place to work. You get pretty well compensated for what you do, and there are actual opportunities to make a difference at leading hospitals across the country.There's no other company like it.Epic has a campus of about 30 buildings, each one has its own theme and they are all connected by tunnels or indoor walkways of some kind, including the underground parking sufficient for more than what's needed by the 10,000 employees. The dress code is ""wear clothes when customers are on campus."" The work is intense and can sometimes require long hours but the culture inspires people to do just that.Fancy work placeWorking environment is very good. Epic has its own coding system. So the bar for the people which is not majored in Computer Science is not high. You will lean a lot about health care.This is a job, not a career.Epic will be the dead-end of your software development career. If you love the Madison area, want a high salary, don't care about learning the latest technologies, and can be a completely independent worker, then it can still be the perfect place for you. But if you're coming out of college and want to continue growing and advancing your career, then this is the worst place you could come to.They do not use recent technologies, the company does not have consistent management practices, and they don't encourage further education after your initial 6 month training. You won't have a team leader giving you feedback and helping you grow, just a boss checking on your deadlines. (*Some people are lucky and get great teams for awhile, but the vast majority of the people I know did not experience this and left within 1-3 years. Unfortunately, so many people get burnt out and leave the company that even if you have a great team for awhile, it's unlikely to stay that way.)Day to day work is bug fixing in your office alone. Epic is a culture of ""self-improvement"" and hidden requirements -- there are unspoken rating and algorithms being used to track you against other workers at the company, and you are expected to be your own motivator and trainer. Epic actively discourages employees from talking to one another about their performance or providing feedback to one another. You must be above average in every category every month within these background algorithms. If you're not, then the company will simply drag you along and get as much work out of you as they can beforeGreat job out of schoolEpic was a great first job because it forces you to get organized if you want to succeed. Getting a good time management system was critical. They throw you right into the work and expect you to handle it. It forces you to learn quickly and could be quite stressful but makes you a better employee overall. The campus is beautiful and lunch is fantastic. Everyone looks out for each other and wants you to succeed.IndependenceLong hours, steep learning curveHighly productive. Culture and environment is incredibleHighly productive work environment. Everyone truly cares about putting in high effort for their job. The campus is essentially an extension of college - many fun things to do, young employees, challenging work.Productive and exciting workplace, but with zero work/life balanceGreat company for people just graduating college, has a great atmosphere and amazing benefits. Not a good company for long term employment. Has an extremely bad work/live balance. Usually end up working long hours at work and then doing more work late at night at home and sometime even having to go back in office. This company hires in reaction to need so your team is always extremely understaffed.Amazing benefits, great work place (your own or shared office), amazing and cheap foodhorrible work/live balanceHigh expectations, potential for fun, great experienceEpic is a place with high expectations of their employees with great reward. Opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people all around the world.Paid very well but very stressfulThey hire a lot of engineers for the TS role, so they pay very well but the hours are long and you are expected to pick up everything as fast as possible. Overall most people I was hired in with left within a year.Good travel benefits, amazing dining halls, young workplace.Long hours, very stressful, shaky management.Productive Environment with Long HoursLong hours but you will grow your knowledge on healthcare and project management immensely. I would reccomend if you are looking for a challenging workplaceStressful and DifficultThis job is a good opportunity for kids fresh out of college to have a lot of responsibility, and have the opportunity to shine early. Sadly, a lack of training, and oftentimes poor scheduling and budgeting for projects can leave the Epic team overloaded with work, and thus leads to high turnover.Fun culture but poor work-life balanceThe majority of the day is spent on customer interactions ranging from basic tech support to advance troubleshooting. The management structure is very flat and you are generally in charge of managing your own work. The campus is very nice and Epic has a very good culinary team that serves lunch every day. Work life balance is poor, you are frequently on call or working late, and travelling can often take up portions of your weekend.Fun place to workThe work I did at Epic was challenging and enriching. There is a steep learning curve, but the work is rewarding and well compensated. I would recommend Epic to anyone looking to work hard in a fun environment.Terrible work life balance, management gets no formal trainingTerrible work life balance. Managers have no formal training and aren’t properly equipped to to foster growth within their employees.Great product.Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price.Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility.

By creating a stellar state of the art medical software they are improving patients' medical care across the world and saving lives. And for that they take what they do very seriously and can be very demanding at times. They place high expectations on you and expect a lot. But it's worth it cause we are helping people after all. And they do, do a lot to be silly and havre fun and create a generally positive environment and atmosphere on the premises and in everything we do. A total joy to work there.12Great Culture; Challenging WorkWork life balance is very challenging if you're in the Implementation division, and travel is often higher than they'll tell you during an interview. A good deal of technical and computer science-related skills are required for Implementation, and if you don't like that, you won't last long. Your early success largely depends on which hospital organization and Epic manager you're assigned to. Most employees are great, but some are checked out.Long hours, unhappy workersEpic invests a lot in the infrastructure and perks in order to make the career bearable but the work life balance is tricky for many and the expectations set are often unfair to employees. Most employees in the PM job roles leave a after a short period of time. Training is disorganized and the management has no training in managing a team so career growth and support through HR related challenges is a hit or miss.beautiful campus, great coworkerscompany culture, environmentFun and engaging workplace that works you hardEpic has a fun campus filled with bright people. If you are ambitious and enjoy the work, you will do well. If you don't meet their high expectations, you may be worked out.All hinges on youIt's not a bad place to work, but it all depends on whether or not you ""drink the kool-aid."" If you do, you could love it. I'm not in that camp, and it's pretty isolating which I did not like.Good first job, poor work-life balanceI've learned a lot during my time at Epic, but the experience overall has been negative. Epic does not respect their employees time, and expects them to give over their lives to Epic to be successful.Good pay and benefitsPoor work-life balanceGreat culture and mission, aggressive work/life balance expectationEpic is a sincere company with a strong, mission-driven corporate culture. Employees with a real passion for the healthcare IT field will do best as the company asks a lot of its employees. However, performance in the PM role has a lot to do with factors that are sometimes beyond one's own control (quality of customer counterparts, feedback coming mainly from one person), meaning job success has a certain element of luck. Those making it past the first year or so can expect extremely competitive raises but also potentially extreme hours and a very demanding travel schedule.An R&D shopFor software developers, your team leader (direct manager) is another software developer. This has great benefits in being able to explain the complexities of a problem/system and propose realistic timelines to achieve milestones.Workplace culture isn't 'startup'-y as some promotional materials may imply, but processes are flexible and serve to make the product better (i.e., they don't just 'exist'). The opportunity to design directly with customers is invaluable – take advantage!The technical stack for most functional areas is limited but largely pliable. Regular work is done to improve developer tooling.Subsidized lunches, great campus, unbeatable healthcareLimited tech stackGreat job, just not what I was looking forI worked as a Technical Problem Solver (TS) for about 6 months before leaving. The work environment and compensation are both wonderful, I just was not very interested in the work itself. You have to spend a lot of time working with customers and the problems that you solve mostly just require troubleshooting rather than reasoning from first principles.Food, EnvironmentNot very interesting workCompany Culture & Coworkers above all elseSuch a fun and creative environment. All my co-workers are incredibly intelligent and driven - I can count on them for anything. The work is meaningful and impactful and that drives what we do and how we do it.No work life balancePrepare to be overworked and undercompensated. Culture isn't great and there isn't a strong emphasis on personal advancement. A lot of disorganized processes.An EPIC careerThe people I worked with at Epic were some of the smartest, most dedicated individuals I have ever met, willing to go above and beyond to improve healthcare and to help our clients successfully achieve their goals.It is not an ""easy"" job and work/life balance can certainly be a challenge. But for me, it was absolutely a worthwhile and rewarding place to work.Stressful, but good for long term career opportunitiesWorking at Epic is a great opportunity for young inexperienced people to launch a career in a booming industry, but it's also extremely stressful and demands sacrifices to work/life balance.Cool culture for an otherwise mundane jobThe best part of working for Epic were my coworkers and the company campus. Other than that, the job and management were pretty lackluster. There were a number of pointless meetings, but I never felt so encumbered with them that I couldn't get my actual job done.Culture, PeopleManagementSolid starting placeIt is a pretty good place to start your career in tech. The culture is alright, a little bit like a cult at some points. Though other starting people usually like to joke about it. The work you do depends heavily on the application you are assigned to.BusyYou will be busy always if you work in the Implementation Division as an application coordinator or manager. The job involves a lot of travel, but it can be fun to rack up the points.They work you hard but give good benefitsThey really do their best to give you good benefits, but the nature of the work is that there will be points where they work you into the ground, and since it is salaried, you don't feel any compensation for the extra work you put in.benefitsIt's a great first jobThe IS division is a great first job as they sculpt you into the type of project manager that work best for IT implementations. There is a steep learning curve, but overall anyone can be successful at this job with hard work.AutonomyEpic gives you a great deal of freedom. You get your own office, control over your workday, great food and benefits. There is a poor work life balance."

While employees are paid well, most are miserable because of issues related to culture/“office politics”. It really is department-specific. Need to be prepared for that trade off.3Some of the management are good - some fakeIf you luck into a department with good management, MISO is an excellent place to be, but the flip side is horrible. It is laced with management who only care about themselves and their own path. People who will step on you to get what and where they want to be.Nice facility, great benefits and PTOManagement1Challenging environmentEach workday can be different. If you are not a transmission expert, you will become one. The company is all business which is good and bad. I loved working in the control room. That is where the action is at.The biggest problem is that your employment may rest with whether the other operators like you or not.Fun Work, not so fun management.If you're a numbers person you'll love the work. Management is a pain, but aren't they all? Flexibility of schedule, if you wanted to take a month off without using vacation, you could by swapping shifts with your counterparts.Exceptional Pay and benefitsManagements nonunderstanding of the job we do. If you were never a Control Room Operator, you shouldn't be a Control Room Manager.Top heavy leadershipVery top heavy leadership with little thought given to decisions made and how it impacts the lives of actual people. Specifically in regards to development managers. Company has eliminated two major departments and their employees which total about 20-30 people in total with many over 10 years of service with MISO. Furthermore, opportunities for leadership are only given to people who will look good in a profile based on diversity and gender. Not based on practical skills.Pay and benefitsHorrible management with unchecked motives and actions.Work was good until the new manager wanted those that manager didn't hire out.It's hard to stay positive when upper management has no respect for the workers who do all the real work. I feel used and unappreciated. The benefits are good and pay is good.Benefits, pay, a few good managersUpper management does not understand what the workers do, lack of respectOverall Great ExperienceCompany location and people are great, was able to maintain a fulfilling work/life balance as an intern, and it seemed like the full timers were able to easily as well.ToxicCompetitive not supportiveLeaders did not empower employeesIncredible business purposeLeadership could not be trustedWould not refer to anyoneBe very carefulMISO is a very competitive company and you can easily go from being considered the best candidate to considered depending on which department and which manager you are working for.Great wages and benefitsYou better want to work at the corporate headquartersExpected perfection from meIn a very, very complicated and imperfect task, perfection was expected of me by a few people and, apparently, the one that mattered most. Someone didn't like my work and they made sure to highlight any perceived mistake that I made to my boss and my coworkers.There may be some good areas to work in at MISO, but mine was not one of them.IT Leadership was disconnected, disinterested, and always in flux.Loved the company and mission, but there was a revolving door with IT Leadership. I was pushed out of the role I was hired for, so a short timer ED could bring in his own guy. Many, many talented, dedicated folks walked away due to the total lack of engaged and knowledgeable leadership. Every new ED, VP, CIO thought they needed to dismantle and rearrange IT to prove their value, and it just got worse with each iteration.free coffee, good coworkersstressful. Once you rose beyond the midpoint of your salary range, you then were susceptible to the annual ""purge the payroll"" list. Great coworkers - mostly the individual contributors, but some managers were good to deal with as well. Interesting business model as a grid manager with ever improving technologies coming into play. Budgeting there seemed to be a perpetual process and moving target - not good for planning.free coffee, competitive salary and benefits, health clinictoxic work environmentGlee clubEnter at your own risk. Great pay and benefits, however, very poor leadership. Co-workers are great to work with, but upper management is a high school glee club.You work long hours in a project only to have it killed and three months later you are invited by another group to start this great project only to find out it was the project you were working on three months ago.A lot is expected of youWhile a lot is expected of you, the pay is pretty good. Benefits are OK. Other employees are pretty good in general to work with and want to make things better. Need to watch out for those looking to get a head. Management is poor and somehow continues to remain in place.Toxic culture. Who you know, not what you knowSadly, MISO is an uninspiring, back-stabbing culture of fear. Executives care about their own perks, not about employees or members. They annually purge talented older workers without reason, and people don't know people are gone until weeks later. It's an abysmal and depressing environment, with constantly changing (phony) rah rah priorities. One ""catch phrase"" doesn't work, so they make up another to try and force employees to be ""engaged"" and ""happy"" with the amoral leadership. Overall, very toxic.High pay and good benefits if you can stand the toxicity and don't mind watching the waste of good talent.Accountants and EngineersPoor communication from the top down and expectation to go to meetings all day and do busy work 50-60 hours a week. Not a good fit for anyone who is self motivated to do meaningful work as you will only be seen as a threat to management. If you excel in a big bureaucracy then you will do fine at MISO.There are always opportunities for free lunchNo opportunity for advancementMISO has changed over the yearsWhen I started at MISO it was a premier place to work, but over the years, they have become less invested in their employees and maybe too big to sustain the original desired culture. I was treated fairly, but many were let go without notice and for no apparent reason.Every year cleansingEvery spring, there is a forced reduction, often of older, higher paid employees, to keep costs lower. Big brain drain.Also, every year or two, there is a new restructuring or strategy direction shift that throws everything into chaos.Not a stable place to work. Seven different managers in only six years...Onsite medical facility and work out roomToo many to specifyGood place to workThere are many different jobs and operations that take place at MISO.

The work culture and environment is friendly. I was always encouraged to try new ideas and process improvements. I had a great time working for Miso.A steaming messMISO is a place in chaos. Draconian management. HR a la ""Catbert"". Antiquated processes with no desire to change them. Horrible IT systems and support. Tasks that should be eliminated go on forever. Compliance framework is made more difficult than it needs to be by overzealous compliance managers. Silos that do not talk. Departments that overlap and compete. Strategy? What strategy? Don't need no stinkin' strategy. Unwilling to address managers with total lack of interpersonal skills. Hires unqualified people to be executives because they know the CEO. Hires other managers with questionable qualifications because they know someone at a high level. It's the old boy network on steroids. Treat contractors like dirt. Refuses to deal with complaints about toxic managers, then blames you for causing problems. Run away and forget about this place.lots of free foodculture sucksOperations AssociateThe time that I spent in this particular role was training focused and the manager gave me immense flexibility and essentially told me to train at my own pace, which is really good. I became NERC certified in 4 weeks, and was on a Real-Time desk within a couple of months.Great place to workI can't speak for the people outside the control room, but we operators have a great schedule, lots of time off, and a laid back environment. T-shirts and jeans on nights and weekends too.DeveloperThe IT division suffers from fiefdoms and managers that are perfect examples of the 'peter principle' at work. The company has an outdated technology stack from 2006 and is slow to adapt to change. Changes are planned over a 2-3 year period, but the budget is re-evaluated every quarter, changing priorities and canceling projects. Enthusiasm for new changes is sparse with most people doing the minimum possible expecting their project to be canceled. Management promotes friends to positions that are not advertised as open. Thinking outside the box is heretical and will be a career killer. Mediocrity and conformity are the words of the day. An example of how employees are treated: PMs were told that the market is saturated and given pay grade decreases by their manager.Benefits are good.

My review is based off of my experience in the Legal Compliance Department. Your experience will be directly tied to your manager and my manager should not have been managing anyone, did not know how to manage and had no time management skills. And if you complain about the work enviroment or treatment, it gets ignored. The HR department is a joke. The money is decent, but if you can find another place to work where you may get a little more support from your HR department or your manager, do so! At my current employer who is in the same industry says that they get a lot of folks from MISO because many either leave or they end up getting fired for petty reasons.

Unfortunately, management at all levels of the company is generally poor. Departments are silos, and certain departments are constantly involved in power struggles to show their worth so that their jobs don't get eliminated. The overall structure of the IT areas of the company, where I work, is ill-conceived and leads to nothing but frustration and poor quality of work. On the plus side, if you can isolate yourself from the politics and the reorgs that happen every year or two and just focus on your work, you can be content. It just depends on your individual manager (a rare few are decent) and the people you work with regularly. Someone wrote a review here referencing a ""low-stress environment."" I have no idea what department that person works in, but in 4 years I have not seen any ""low-stress environments"" at MISO. Compliance with regulations is a constant stressor. If you're looking for low stress, MISO is definitely not for you.interesting industrypoor management, low opportunity for advancementGreat CultureMiso is a great place to work and grow.

The management and the work life balance leave something to be desired. Overall it is a good company.Ahern has policies and procedures which may not match industry standards.This is construction so the office hours start at 7 AM and should end at 4 to 4:30 PM.

Morally questionable business dealings. No loyalty to hardworking employees.

There are many companies out there that actually invest in their hardworking people, don't waste your time with how they talk themselves up.

Our division was too frequently managed by fear. This division has a tendency to role multiple roles into one associate. What I did for them used to be done by 3 or more people. The hardest part of the job was meeting the elevated expectation of my most recent manager. Three years ago, they increased my budget by 250% so, even though I had very solid years based upon previous goals, it became exceptionally challenging to meet their expectations.The most enjoyable part was serving our customers and designing solutions to meet their fire suppression needs. I also enjoyed my co-workers who felt more like family to me.Designing solutions; benefits; co-workers.Unrealistic expectations and fear culture of our divisional management.Not EqualDoes not treat employees fair nor equal.

I think that some of the management is partial to all employees. And the fact that at no point did we find out about benefits which most employers tell you about during the new hire process was brought up by this employer. Even more so when one inquired about this to other employees no one could answer on this. I learned that they expect perfection once you get hired there even if it is something you have never done before.

No es líder y sin capitán el barco se hunde.SalarioPersonalMehThe pay socks! During the interview I was told there would be perks for being at work. I have yet to see anything like that. There were 3 people that was given extra work that received gift cards. I wasn't a part of that group. 😕.NaIt's a clickish companyInsufficient trainingNot enough training to meet metrics and make candidates happy. Employees are not valued or paid well enough to care. No room for advancement. Very clique-y and the call center environment is toxic.TipsManagement needs to give more recognition. And it’s seems management gets an awful lot for the minimal work they do as the Tcas put in the most work to then be having to fight too hard for the smallest increase of a raise . That is aside from the fact that the base rate is too lowFor what is it is we are trained to do.Underpaid and no leadership involvement.I love my job most days. However, when need assistance there is no one to reach out to. Also, way underpaid for the fact that I am to respond to emails whenever received. I am required to work 24/7 yet not paid for this.401 k and holiday payCan’t take vacation during the summer because company won’t hire additional help.No growth or benefitsNo professional growth or benefits. Micromanagement does not helps and non-sense rules. Apply for this job only for few months.Prometric: Start compensating your staff and you will not have so much employee turnover.You operate on your own which is niceWork hours differ depending on how many candidates show up. Very laid back atmosphere. Management is usually available via phone if you have questions. There is also an IT dept. that is very helpful when needed.ManagementI enjoyed working for Prometric. I had all the support from my management when need. Work schedule was balanced with my life schedule. I would definitely work for Prometric again or refer new staff to the company.I was able to add / gain managerial experience from my upper management through their support and guidance.Great communication between mnagementN/aVery stressful place to workBut if you know what you’re doing and pay attention to the training it’ll be some what easy, some of the mangers are very lazy but the coworkers are wonderfulproductive and welcomingI had alot of fun building my skills as a trainer. they employ people from diverse backgrounds and it was a pleasure being a part of the team. I felt welcomed and includedunderpaid, overstressed employees from entry level through mid-managementVery little concern or effort is given to entry level staff which creates negativity that moves upward through the ranks creating extremely poor service and an unfriendly environment where standard customer service KPI's are nothing more than an afterthought. Upper management is in place simply because they have been there 20+ years, NOT because of experience or intelligence.NothingUnhappy, underpaid and stressed cultureEasy but boring and viciously underpaidPoorly run company (programs freezing all the time, tests crashing, unable to print score reports. Still paying just a couple of bucks over min wage and requiring huge responsibilities. Constant monitoring by video and audio recordings - can be mind-numbingly boring just staring at a screen all day.Went downhill fastHonestly it was easy. We had a full staff. The issue was the staff. The staff began to leave and corporate forced full time on permanents. We were working 10 or even 13 hours a day. Poor pay. Constant tech issue were a problem for test takers and employees. Unfortunately many test takers were forced to reschedule which is very inconsiderate of the company. Corporate knew about this issues. This tech issues existed at every location. Corporate didn’t care how far these people drove. How much time they wasted here. This is very shameful. Corporate is very inconsistent and inconsistent. Our Client Practice or our go by the book is very inconsistent.Great manager. Great co workersTerrible management. Low pay. Long hours.Not a great companyWhile my individual center is great, corporate is a joke. I was made manager around a year in when the previous one quit. Even as a tcm, I make less than a liveable wage. Nobody is going to want to work for that low of pay and I don't blame them. As a result I have only myself and one employee. Corporate doesn't care that I'm so short staffed and frequently tries to make us be open for 10-12 hour days. Tech and operations support are both jokes, as they don't listen and often can't fix anything. The website we are told to refer to is constantly broken. There is no support from corporate or the owner of our location.Interesting people, easy jobLow pay, corporate is awful, no support, stressfulThe actual work is not that difficultUpper management do not have their priority straight. A lot of defects and bugs with our application; however not much resources is to provided to fix them.Dismal pay and no chance for advancementPrometric pays $9 hourly to start. Prometric considers this to be a living wage! A worker might receive a .25 raise after the first year. Employees were payed monthly. This is not the place where employees are valued. The dismal pay coupled with a manger who didn't value employees led to VERY high turnover.Management doesn't care about employeesThis place has a toxic work environment, no room for advancement, and not competitive with pay. Management doesn't care about employee needs and will deny time off for Drs appointments.Test Center Administrators Poorly CompensatedTCAs need better pay. Work is boring, but flexible work life balance for sure. Learned a lot about different tests for different jobs. Pretty chill work culture.Not a good place to work!They tell you one thing and the job calls for something totally different. They can make easy things overbearing. There is no logic in the procedures and they can often be misleading. The interview were a bunch of alternative facts!Coworkers can be helpful.Short breaks, never a clear answer to questions, write ups with no warnings, constant changes in policies and work procedures, more work then pay, controlling by fear, micromanaging, and multiple opinions on how the job should be done.Very routine job. But once you develop your flow, its not bad.There were strict guidelines to the work. There are a number of hostile customers. You just have to explain and follow the procedure. The job does get monotonous at times. But you learn to develop your customer service skills. Not much growth potential.Interesting productA little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help.Working at Chicago Prometric was terribleDon’t waste your time the management at the Chicago office was terrible they keep up a lot of confusion they talk about you behind your back and make up lies. One supervisor worked there for 20 years she was the main one.It is not a professional place. They want you to do a lot of work they don’t want to pay it’s always technical problems with the computers.Prometric upper management had no type of i innovation. They and I repeat they do not Value their employees. The place is a revolving doorMeeting the candidates Who are taking their testWalking in the door of that place to clock in3Productive workplaceEnjoyed working for Prometric, if you need help with anything your needs will be addressed quickly. I feel supported at my job. Only downfall is the pay and sometimes the hours.1Mentally exhausting but the people can make or break your experience.Turnover rate is high and it's frustrating to constantly teach new employees. Also, your coworkers will make or break your experience. You either love it or hate it. Patience is key because candidates can be difficult, but my manager supported me so I felt confident in my work.Computer skills neededThe job itself was a great experience. It’s a chance to meet a variety of people from all walks of life. There was a coworker or two left a bad taste in my mouth. Very unprofessional in attire, attitude, and work ethic.Easy but not compensated properlyThe job itself, as a proctor, is easy. However, the pay compensation, for the amount of ""security"" you are performing is highly underpaid. Also, the tech support is a complete joke and hassle that you deal with basically on a daily basis.Happy placeVery productive work place, their pantry is big, with games, big screen, high bar style table and tool. The overall office is well organised by sections. People are all very friendly, polite and humble from Top level.They have regular get together, celebrating special occasions. They also have task assigned for month awareness.No commentStress free job, set own hoursLove my job working for Prometric. I have been an employee for seven years now. It is a fun, stress free job. You can be flexible with your hours as well.The pay was low for the job and the area so they had a hard time keeping employeesOriginally this was a great part time job for a retiree. The job was not hard to learn , the site manager would work with you on a schedule and one got to meet a range of different people every day. But as the job market became tighter the company did not respond to the growing wage market so they had a hard time keeping or finding employees due to their low pay scale. Soon after being hired there were only 2 employees left, the manager and myself. The daily hours got longer, sometimes we were working 10-11 hour days., 4-5days a week! Corporate management was horrible to work with and provided no support at all for the site. Their solution was to have us hire temps as replacements for employees at a higher price range than even the manager was making but the temps would not show up. Eventually the manager even quit. A month later after working full time hours, acting as the site manager and training the frequent temporaries , I was still getting the pay of a part time employee, so I also quit. It was obvious that they don't value their employees very well.It was not really a stressful job and had decent benefits for a PART TIME position, Great for retirees!Low pay for full time employees and site managers, No support for site offices from corporate or regional managers, Outdated and low quality equipment at testing sitesNot A place to make your careerJob was okay for what it was but it's no room for growth or a raise. They will use you up and when you ask about a raise or room for advancement they will give you the run around. And not to mention being a contract employee with no paid holidays or any kind of benefits. It's some good people people in mangement but they overworked and overlooked too! That's why the turnover rate so high! And the pay is wayyyy below average!Nothing!!!Pay No paid holidays if you a contract employee and no room for advancement and no raises.Manager is sincere and caring. Very fair and he’s considerate.A lot of intricate things to remember about each test. Always on cameras. Not much time to even grab a sip of water. Can be extremely stressful, low pay for what you do.Great managerBoring and stressfulPrometric is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for.They do not post positions in time for internal candidates to apply. For their top positions, they always hire from the outside which leaves no room for advancement. Prometric always tries to eat more than it can chew at once. Thus employees are expected to bleed if necessary to get things done. To stay up to date with the workload, you need to invest at least 16 hours. If you cannot because of family or other commitments, you are not viewed in a good light by management.Long days, Abrasive treatment of employees by management, no follow up from HR when formal complaints are submitted, no room for advancement, create new titles/roles to demote employees without their knowledge.Fun place work but does get hecticGreat place to work just make sure your great at multitasking and a quick learner it’s really fast paced and busy but other that it’s relaxed once the rush cools downGreat perdiem jobGreat job for a nurse looking for perdiem work, you can work the days that are best for you, you have autonomy, great support and travel opportunities. You can do your paperwork at home and you are reimbursed for your time and resources. It is an high quality company with a high standard of excellence.Job description, supervisorPay, computer process can be challengingGreat management and work life balance.Prometric is a very good company. The have sites across the US. They also have very high standards for a testing company. Pay is decent for what job entails. You are never left without help. Your supervisor and IT are always s available.When your finished at the site, you are finished for the day.Travel involvedI really enjoy my time at Prometric.A lot of changes in upper management but I have had a good experience with Prometric. Underpaid TCAs make it hard to find staff but otherwise a great place to work.Schedule flexible, management greatNot paid enough to maintain a staff long termIn and out type jobIt's a good part time job while in college, or working other jobs on the side.

It is an easy job but it can get boring really fast. Management is terrible at this location.easyboringRoutine Job with small yet annoying irregularitiesThis is pretty much one of the easiest jobs I’ve worked. The job is pretty much self explanatory after training and easy to get help if need be. Management is great. You definitely have your good and bad days like any other job but for the most part its a fair deal.Easy WorkCan get boringUnderpaidThe work we did for our candidates was fulfilling. Employees are underpaid compared to other local call centers. Management was often toxic and passive aggressive.Nice facilityManagement during my tenure was terrible.Interesting productA little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help.Training is thorough.I was a temp working for Prometric. Great hours, good training but i had to catch 3 buses to get there. Potential to go permanent but if you owe the irs or have any felonies you will not be hired permanently.Training, good coworkersLocation71Fun place to work part timeGreat place to work part time. The pay is pretty low but if you’re young with not a lot of responsibilities it can work. The secret shops can make or break your location2You'd might as well work at an asylum!Immediately, there is no promotions or advances based on seniority or experience. This is strictly a place that functions off of favorability and how much of someone else's job you can cover. In 2 1/2 years, I was assigned up to 8 different supervisors (most quit, switched departments or excelled to other positions). Human Resources quit just before we furloughed due to Covid-19 and after returning, I had to reach out to HR from another location for two weeks straight just to be added back onto the payroll. It's still going downhill. From the SR VP on down, everyone is just too entitled to band together for a greater cause!No dress codeEveryone knows Everything, no incentives, visitors from the other offices don't like to wear their masks indoorsA stepping stoneIt was not a bad place to work but pretty boring.… Checking people in and out, monitoring tests and clean up at the end of the shift it’s about the extent of the job.Work was easy, coworkers friendlyVery sedentary, boring job. No opportunity for advancement.HorribleNo room for growth. High turnover rate. Very poor salary. Outdated tech, I mean I use a laptop from like 10 years ago. The management was ok for my particular department. I liked my manager. But that was the only thing I liked about working herePTO I guessEverything hahaMicromanaged and exhaustingI was a Test Center Manager for 5 years and it was not a pleasant experience. The work they expect you to get done with the amount of staff they allow you to have scheduled is unrealistic. There is minimal work/life balance - if you have not incurred any vacation time then you will be denied any time off request even if it’s only one day. I was micromanaged to the extreme. They continue to try to raise their security standards and yet continue to schedule bare minimal staff. My employees were burnt out as was I. Try to steer clear of this company.Breaks & Lunch were above average compared to other companiesSalary was below average given the amount of responsibilities, expensive benefits, no option of unpaid time offBusy pacedCool place to work at. But can be busy working at the call center. Some days could be slow while others very fast paced. Must have good customer service skills in order to do this job well.Benefits, other employee perksBusy daysBoring low payThis was one of the worst jobs I ever had. The only saving grace was the co-workers. Low pay and no hours. It didn't even pay to drive to the job. You just sit there and watch people on video taking a test. Occasionally you get up and do a walk Thu. It was so boring.CoworkersEverything elseA simple yet rewarding jobWorking there was rewarding for me. The staff and manager were very helpful and supportive, and proctoring was the best part of the job. However, you might need an extra source of income since hours can be cut down due to how many candidates are scheduled on certain days or what days your site is open.Good pay, fun and easyMight get less hoursOverall good part-time jobEven though people probably come into this job thinking they will just sit and do nothing, it actually is a lot of tedious work you need to do. With that being said, my manager (Bethesda,MD) was kind to me and was always respectful. Due to the customer service aspect of this job, it can get stressful but the work itself was manageable. It is not labor intensive though it can require you to be focused in a boring environment.There is little to no advancement. Most people are working here as a part-time job while in college or people who want few hours.Relatively stagnant job with some high stress moments.Prometric is a great testing company, but it’s boring to work for. You check people in and out of their tests, do security checks, sign them in an out for restroom breaks, walk through the testing area to make sure there is no cheating, and the rest of the time you sit at a desk and watch people test. I doubt there is a more boring job. You can’t read, color, draw, be on your phone, or anything else while monitoring the testers. It’s a job that doesn’t change very much day to day so that’s a plus, but there are some high stress moments when you forget to do something, the testers don’t listen and you end up in trouble, or when Prometric pays people to come and try and catch you not doing your job well.Consistent work duties.Boring, short breaks.Ok company to work for.Good company to start a career. They promote from within so there are chances to work your way up. They value the most customer service and attention to detail.Exciting and room to improve yourselfI worked in a company for 18 years and then moved into a company to become an I.T field technician first company was a terrible place to work 2nd company was better but lacked training and salary options, Moving to Prometric was an amazing opportunity that I jumped on when a recruiter asked me would i be interested in going for an interview . The interview was focused on me as a person rather than my qualifications which is a great way to do an interview as you want the person more than the qualifications I believe ,the interview process was friendly informative , told me about what they do asked me a lot of good questions about me as a person how I manage people and changes and conflicts was a very healthy and informative interview and I came away from it happy and felt it was great interaction.Great Salary, opportunity to move up, travel and exciting new places to visit. Global interaction from all over the world, great management team who are consistently promoting good core values and peoples mind and health .noneIt's a job, not a careerIt's a P/T job, even if a person requests more hours. Schedule and hours are inconsistent. Schedule can include evenings, weekends, and holidays. It's nearly impossible to take time off. Manager is erratic.Pay better than minimum wageFrequently too busy to take breaks, time off requests deniedPoor Management & Job CulturePros+Exposure to the assessment industryCons-Commercial organization ran by people totally out of touch with the industry, all about bottom-line/revenue, and does not recognize internal staff-Over worked and under compensated-Rarely promotes within-If promoted, the rate is 3% pay increaseDo your research before entering this company. If you search around LinkedIn, you will notice many employees leave this organization for another inside the assessment industry. This is not by chance - Prometric is a poor company to work for. They expect you to over work, with nothing in return.Assessment IndustryRead Review, Low Salary, Over Worked, No PromotionsTest Center ManagerI was with the company for 3 years. No room for advancement. They work you to the bone. Pay and hours are bad. Went from working a steady Monday through Saturday to working Mondays, Tuesdays, Friday's. Raises were bare minimum and I mean barely 30cents for flawless execution of job even though the minimum wage was steadily rising. At a certain point TCAs and TCMs will probably be paid the same.HealthcareAggressively underpaid, no steady pay check, no room for advancing, no support, lack of trainingTest centerMarket driven testing schedule, so hours fluctuated. So full time work wasn't always full time hours. Staffing shortages that took a long time to fill.office environmentstaffing shortagesdysfunctional company on a path to the bottomYou'll spend most of your time putting out fires for a company that refuses to invest in itself. Prometric's business strategy is to try and gain clients faster than they lose them while never addressing the root of their problems. Tolerable if you just need a job. People do not tend to stay long so not much community/culture.Low standards so you can get away with the bare minimumBelow average pay, drama, no growth so no opportunity for advancementGreat company with limited hoursThis is a great company but I would not recommend it for anyone looking for steady full time hours. As a office manager I am responsible for ensuring all rules&regulations are being followed at the test center. The hours are based off of operational needs so some days you may only work four hours. Also the test center is only open three days a weekAbility to manage freelyLimited hoursPoor ManagementVery few hours, sometimes 1day a month, hours not fairly distributed, don’t waste your time. This was a franchise so the owners were never present and took very little interest in day to day operations.EasyBoring, can’t leave area, no hours"
Relativity,"Customer Support Management is terribleI would not recommend working for Relativity. The management team is the worst I have worked for at any company. There is a massive learning curve that happens at this company that they have failed to fix in the entirety that I was there. Unfortunately, this has caused a massive exodus of techs over the last year with over 1/3 of the team finding new jobs.Unlimited DTOextreme micromanagement, lack of training resources, management team has no product knowledge2Enjoyable, maybe not the most excitingAs an intern, I didn't get as much exposure as I wanted, in terms of working on the customer-facing product. I was working mostly on an internal tool, which was still a lot of fun, but I didn't learn as much as I wanted to learn. However, the people and management are great to work with, from what I've seen in my short time.Great office, unlimited discretionary PTODidn't learn as much as I wanted to1The boys club.Growing company that needs best practices from the outside.Some functions are slower to adjust than others. What worked to get to 2019 is not scalable and management is resistant to change for fear of job loss.21In a growth period moving from startup to established company.Facebook-like culture, to a degreeStill adopting a cloud focusSome product decisions seem arbitraryMultiple verticals means more meetingsEncourages learningI found their tech not very excitingAbsolute leader in their space (Litigation Support)Great customer service organizationVery good compensation / benefitsSlow release cycleVery poor managementRelativity is a good place to work if you are straight out of college. If you are an experienced professional, be ready to face the triad of inexperienced senior management. Be ready to flatter and please, then you will be promoted. It doesn't matter if you have experience or not, be ready to please even more, especially in HR. They hire, fire, and promote as they want. Processes? Nope, never heard of it. Relativity is a good company, HR there is the weakest link. No competent person would ever join that team. Pass.BenefitsPoor managementVery Toxic, Tech Writers BewareNote to tech writers: Watch what you step into. Don't let them waste your time. The documentation team has a history of problems with bad management that senior leadership has refused to address and even covered up (with lots of help from HR). They couldn’t keep the writers that had any kind of experience and skills, so your interviewing team is going to look like they are auditioning to be cast in ""Clueless."" A lot of these problems are due to the fact that documentation team is structurally misplaced into the Support organization where writers are treated like clerical personnel. The culture emphasizes micromanagement, decision-making by committee, and conformity, and is overtly hostile to any kind of initiative and independent thinking. It is the opposite of the cool and hip West Coast-style software development company image that Relativity wants you to believe it is.Reasonable compensation, generous education budgetPoor management, classless HR practicesvery diversegreat place to work if you're starting your career and know what you want for your future. Training provided take advantage an grow along with the companyToxic managementEmployees outside management level hold this failing company together.

Changes were on the horizon when I left but it wasn't soon enough to keep me.Up-beat, fast-paced company with lots of great people.Some departments had poor managers.Fun coworkers, management is iffyI liked 1/3 of my managers here but the work was good, I made a lot of friends, and there were nice perks to working here. The teams had varying levels of intensity, and there wasn’t always clarity on expected skills. Overall a solid place, but don’t stay too long.Nice amenities, friendly environmentLack of clarity in career advancementVery comfortable environment to work in.The environment was very comfortable to work in and the people are great to work with. There was one drawback. You needed to pass their Certification examination. The certification is based on the company's flagship application. I understand the reason to know the application, but I disagree that you need to pass the exam to continue employment with this company. The exam for most of the employees is not really needed to do the job they were hired for. If I knew how tough this exam was I would not have accepted this position.Excellent BenefitsPassing their CertificationGood company - terrible managementThe company is good. The people there are unbelievable to work with - extremely smart, humble and are always willing to help you out.The management on the other hand has no idea what it is doing.

Mayo Clinic,"Quality patient careGreat pay, great benefits. Good references, good place to have on your resume, prestigious, nice nurses and patients, new equipment, flexible scheduleInstitutional Pharmacy Tech IIIt has been great to work at Mayo, the work culture and the leadership are excellent. Be prepared to work hard every day. The workload at Mayo continues to increase on a daily basis.Great pay and benefitsWorking every other weekendgreatgreat please to work. decent pay and great benefits. campus is also beautiful with lots of options for lunch (great food trucks). co workers and doctors are great tooMinimal advancement, great jobLove my job, work with great people. Minimal opportunities for advancement. Fun group to work with. A part of ever changing policies with transplantationAmazing work cultureThere's a reason Mayo is considered the best. As a PCA the responsibilities are the same as anywhere but the pay rate is the highest I've seen in the valley. The people there are amazing and teamwork is very much the core of what makes Mayo, well Mayo.Toxic culture, too many chiefs not enough LeadersThe Bad:Pay increases rarely keep up with cost of living increases and when raises are given they are too little and too late.Mayo is in a state of terminal decline. Many of the staff are demoralized and it gets worse every quarter. Turf wars are commonplace and the sense of camaraderie and teamwork is eroding away. While the intranet may exude positivity the general consensus of the staff is a sense of helplessness and lack of common direction.Insurance companies that Mayo utilizes will fight you tooth and nail over every single health expense. It's exhausting.If you are the kind of person to report toxic behavior or to blow the whistle on poor work practices be prepared to be managed out.The Good:If you know where to look their are free(!) career development opportunities open to Mayo employees that will help you find a job with a better organization.Mayo has finally caught on to digital pathology and using AI to help consultants work-load. If you have strong computer skills now is a great time to get involved in the department.If you are obsequious or can fake it, Mayo is a great place to work.The current attitudes are ""come late, leave early"", ""do as little as you have to"", and ""don't try to change anything"". This is great for work-life balance!The dismissal process is so tough and time-consuming that like government work once you are employed at Mayo you can stay there until you retire if you so choose.Great CompanyGreat company with great values and leadership. Great job for taking the next step in your career. decent pay but good job security and you can make friendsTerrible pay for the work you doThey’re strict about clocking in a minute early or late. Unpaid lunch breaks (they clock you out automatically for 30 min). PCA resource team is terrible to do and you’re stuck in it for a year. I wanted to go to one specific unit and I wasn’t allowed to. They don’t train good unless you get one of the few good PCAs.1 starWhat is the best part of working at the company?Co workersWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The hours, the amount of overtime hours. Your raises are set, not based on a performance evaluation. Lack of trainingWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment is good, culture is pretty good tooWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?Mandatory overtime to start the work day, pick orders well above the quota requirements, and then get forced to stay more overtime at the end of the shift. Typically 1 hour to 3 hoursIt was okNurses and other staff members showed favoritism. And they don’t care about their employees or any situations they may be going through. The pay was ok.Great benefits, job securityOverall a great company to work for. Nice people and able to work remotely and pick work hours within reason. We receive a nice amount of PTO and the medical benefits are great.work from home, great benefitsnot much flex time anymoreNot what it used to beIt's not the big cool mayo it used to be. They're more concerned with their image and money now than anything else. The pay is lower than many similar postions elsewhereGood place to workGood place to work, the food and coffee all over the facility was one of the best parts. Management for my department was poor and very divided from what happened at the floor levelMayo has lost their wayMayo has lost their way and is nothing like their mission “the needs of the patient come first.” They have become about money and not about their patient.Management is clueless how to do their job. They can’t lead a job in a department they have no work experience in at all.BenefitsManagement, Patient care, toxic cultureOverall goodOverall good place to work. Get raises often and benefits are decent. Management can improve a little bit,but over all good! If you work remote, insurance is a pain outside of the state so be awareImmense satisfaction of being very productive of your career.Working at Mayo Clinic was a very positive professional Nursing Experience. I worked in a Cardiac surgical ICU and had a very thorough orientation of intensive patient care. I worked in the unit for five years, and then transferred to the ED and worked in that area for the next twenty five years. I had the opportunity of several assignments along with Emergency Nursing. It has been an extremely fulfilling career.Pro/major conCo workers are amazing. Very rewarding taking care of patient and patient family members. Staff is underpaid and overworked. RNs working with heavy/unsafe work assignments.Good Hours and PayI enjoyed my time at mayo clinic very much. Shifts were always 5am-5pm 3 days a week and there was good benefits. Sometimes I would have to miss a break if we were busy though.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?The benefits are very good- they do offer a pension as well as a very respectful attitude with all staff I worked in the Outpatient Chemotherapy Unit- great manager and strong teamWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Some days were really busy but there is a great team attitude and everyone jumps into help when neededWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is cohesive and inclusive- it can be very fast paced .The physical environment is beautiful and peacefulWhat is a typical day like for you at the company?As a Chemotherapy RNThe first hour we are drawing lands and peeping charts for the next day and stocking rooms if needed.

I am, but if I were not I don't know that I could put up with the NP bullying.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?the company always encourages tattle tailing and make other people business your business, and report to anyone that will listen even if there is nothing to report, you can make it up or just say ""not sure what this means, but I think I am uncomfortable with it"" Mayo supports immaturity, this establishes the need for more mgtWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?work straight forward, culture constantly changing to whatever is against nature and God.What is a typical day like for you at the company?what my certification is in and I love my kind of work certified wound, ostomy and cont. nurseQuality patient careGreat pay, great benefits. Good references, good place to have on your resume, prestigious, nice nurses and patients, new equipment, flexible scheduleToo bigTruly a company where the patient comes first. They are always striving to improve and become more efficient. You have to be willing to be patient for changes to occur - it is a large company with many factors for them to consider when implementing change. But they are open to suggestions and recommendations. You need to be persistent if you have strong concerns or suggestions.2 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?The patientsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Adapting to new hire supervisors who have no idea how to do your jobWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Confusing.

Management and coworkers were professional and kind. The second best part was the training. It was very thorough. They have a ton of policies and procedures at Mayo that must be followed strictly and will be closely monitored. I liked this, but if you don't like that then it's probably not the place for you. I was hoping to stay with them forever, but opportunities took me out of the area and there was no work remote option at that time.The Ship has hit the iceberg.Mayo has excellent clinicians and most try to do right by the patient. On the other hand, their previous research and innovation pipelines are in a tail spin.The previously innovative culture is now on a fast decline.My manager is excellent, however our senior leadership is very disconnected and operates in their own fantasy. Feedback becomes heavily filtered en-route to the top, so getting progress towards some initiatives requires creative bypasses.On the clinical side, nursing and ancillary support staff are leaving in droves. Most clinical departments are understaffed when their used to be extra staffing.Most of my division has a decade or more in service to the institution; however, we're on our way out the door.Terrible if in a unionOk workplace unless you are unfortunate enough to work at a location that is a union location. I believe there are 2 such locations in Minnesota. In the last year, mayo has announced 2 significant raises for non union staff( while heaping on the praise for work well done). These raises do not include union workers and Mayo is refusing to reopen wage negotiations despite my union’s efforts to get them to do so. I am held to the same standard that my coworkers are held to. I meet and exceeded the standards, and this is just a horrific way to treat their people. I honestly believe that they are really trying to get rid of us (Even if they can’t outright fire us).Wonderful coworkersWages for union workers, ability to take a same day PTO is severely limitedLow pay for the work. Co-workers are awesomeOverall it is a good place to work for. If you do not have an education it is hard to move around. Stay away from anything that requires a 2 year commitment.Great cowrkersExtremely strict about time off. No sick leave. Get written up for going home sick.Excellent careI love working for one of the best, a world renowned institution. It offers a pension plan which not all healthcare offers nowadays.You can expect excellent quality care when you go.to to any Mayo campuses.Mayo doesn’t live up to the stated missionI’m one of quite a few physicians leaving Mayo Clinic recently. Mayo Clinic no longer lives up to its long standing mission IMO. It’s not the patients needs that come fist now but the financial needs of the clinic that come first. This permeates the new culture of Mayo in all aspects and on all levels. Physicians are treated poorly. Yes, the benefits are good for now (not great as they used to be) but that’s not everything that makes someone love their job. Mayo is all about rules and yet they selectively apply them. I’ve witnessed multiple instances of unfair treatment of junior faculty and yet the same rules don’t apply to the leadership and senior staff. One well-known example of Mayo’s hypocrisy is letting VP Pence tour Mayo Clinic unmasked during the peak of Covid while firing staff for being unvaccinated. Many more examples behind the curtains that I don’t want to delve into right now. In short, Mayo’s Financial needs come first. Hypocrisy at its finest.benefits (but they are eroding yearly)new culture, corporate values, hypocrisyintimidatingintimidating culture, and threatening leadership.Over many years working at Mayo I realized that they increase pay once sense general discontent of employees and before they are about to work people to death.Recent pay raise is only making me curious what’s coming. Mayo only cares about money and recent earnings weren’t that great so they will be making people work harder but to do so they need to motivate people (hence pay raise). Mark my words next 6 months we will find out what is behind the pay raise and how much more life Mayo will suck out of its employees.Perfect companyFlexible hours and shifts, great management, fair pay, holiday bonuses, job securityEndless opportunities for growth. Mayo will even pay for further educationAmazing culture, slow business growthMayo Clinic has an amazing patient-oriented culture. Because of that, it is not the most progressive business culture. Many rules and assumptions are barriers to doing business, especially in competitive landscapes. It's a great place to settle down in, but not the best place to build a budding career, especially if you like to think outside the box. I do hope for the sake of them thriving and spreading their stellar customer service perspective, that they can stay competitive and innovative without losing their unique Mayo touch.Education and ResearchGreat place to work. Quality and excellence put together. Diversity and inclusion stand out. Quality patient care. A workplace where patients comes first.Work environmentVery toxic. Management doesn't care at all. Short staffed constantly and when asked management questions, answer was "" some care is better than no care"".No lunch break at times, short staffed constantly, toxic environmentThe Mayo talking points do not match realitySo many issues... as with many hospitals, I'm sure. Clinical decisions (such as nurse/patient staffing ratios) being made by people who are not clinical and who don't have a clue what a typical shift is like for nurses. Administration doesn't listen to concerns or suggestions of employees, yet wonder why they are chronically understaffed and have to pay out the butt for travelers.Wonderful co-workers for the most partYou are a cog in the machine, administration for the most part truly doesn't care about the employees.anxiety provoking workplaceall three years I’ve worked here have been full of anxiety for me despite the fact i have no anxiety issues outside my Mayo work place.I’ve been experiencing constant anxiety from micromanaging supervisor and unsupporting staff. I’ve been sabotaged by my coworkers and vilified by a supervisor. This is not the way to treat other people.Very disheartening experience working at so called top hospital. You should be ashamed of yourselves.Structure and known expectationsThere is structure and you always know the expectation or standard you are being held to. It is bigger and sometimes you can feel like just another number but the direct supervisors in your department really help to make you feel that you are really part of a team.Very organized and supportedMayo has so many resources for bedside RN’s. You won’t get overwhelmed with labs, IVs, hanging blood or even doing a urinary caths because there are teams for that. This ultimately means you get to focus on providing best possible patient care. Ratio in PCU was 2-3 patients and ICU is 1-2. Great place for nurses.Toxic place, your experience may vary based on your managerMy manager micromanaged me and sometimes came just short of breathing down my neck. Some of the mangers were nicer and actually cared about their employees. This really damaged the relationship. In addition, there is so much red tape to go through to do even simple things. This is easily the worst place I have worked at.Worse jobWorse job ever. Co workers weren’t very welcoming. Instead of teaching you how to do a certain task, they yell at you and talk behind your back. Super toxic environment and managers don’t do anything about it either. This job gave me anxiety everyday I went in. Don’t consider working here, it’s not worth it and you don’t get paid enough to deal with everyone.Quality patient careGreat pay, great benefits. Good references, good place to have on your resume, prestigious, nice nurses and patients, new equipment, flexible scheduleVery good place to workI've enjoyed my time here at mayoPretty friendly environment and lots of fun activities for acknowledgement of the hard workers in mayo. Everyone working there is kind.14Favoritism, horrible managementLet’s just say that if you get a Manager/Supervisor that likes you the least out of the other staff for no reason at all- they will do and make it their mission to get rid of you! So make sure you do what it takes to stay within the circle or your job security dramatically drops!4Good benefits , plenty of overtime and promotions availableWorked there for too many yrs. Did get burnout from working a lot of overtime when offered. People were friendly at first and then became judgmental as time went on. Maybe they were just bored with their boring lives. Small town atmosphere and gossipy. Day to day you are busy with a structured schedule and know what is expected of you . Management changes often and suddenly with little notice .Then the new manager wants to change everything down to what is expected of the peon .Great benefits and job opportunities for advancement if you are like minded . A lot of favoritism is in the choosing. Sad that people were mostly toxic and clique. If I could change anything. It would be that I would of left many years ago. Don't stay there for as long as I did and become part of the furniture. I never missed any one or wanted to go back. Says a lot. Missed the benefits and that's about it.good place to workthe PACU is a great place to work. The team is very helpful. Hard to get time off but since the union is no longer present I dont know how that will changeDecent benefitsDecent benefits, some potential for good work relationships. Parking situation was not good. Only option for on site parking is if your shift is before 430am or have been there for decades.... always plenty to doExpensive lunch options on siteGreat Benefits, Long HoursThe benefits and experience of working at a nationally ranked hospital are wonderful. However, minimal work life balances and often feel like a number.Mayo Clinic Toxic CultureI never thought I would say that Mayo Clinic has a problem of toxic culture but after working in multiple departments and I now realize that the workplace toxicity I encountered in one department was not unique. It’s not easy at first to identify how toxic people are because people appear nice and friendly BUT the more time I spent there the more it’s become obvious how toxic culture of the clinic is and how dishonest and vindictive management. It trickles from the top to bottom.StabilityMy career at Mayo was highly stable. The need was always there. I spent 21 years with Mayo Clinic and I enjoyed my jobs. I found a new career path a year ago and needed a change.Insurance BenefitsManagementall about ranking and revenuePoor training, lack of support, inadequate pay ,management favoritism and huge staff turnover.Micromanagement in all aspects of the job.Working there was a nightmare.Leadership is too busy being concerns about ranking and revenue. Staff is disposable to them until we all stand up and say enough is enoughSub par benefits and overworkedIn 2019 mayo had excellent benefits but they've been going downhill and we are all extremely overworked. The health insurance is excellent but most other benefits are average or below average. The pay is also below average compared to other sites.Good companyCompany overall was okay to work for. The floor I worked on was hard. Nursing manager was terrible. Made staff cry. Need to request off way ahead of time to get it approved. Parking is terrible.We have a strong sense of purposeMayo Clinic has a strong sense of purpose which is ""the needs of the patient come first."" This holds true for all jobs throughout the hospital even those that are not direct patient care. Management strives to provide a positive learning environment for their staff while encouraging them to grow and learn new skills.great benefits packageshort staffedFlexible work lifeMayo is great , some old processesLots of people to network withNo bonusesThey don't counter offerRaises are below inflation ratesThey have a pensionTerrible attitudes because of ManagementMayo don't pay fair . Management tell employees one thing , but does something different. I hire was 4 ten. Now they take that a way. One main reason I took the job. This place is so top heavy on management. They preach about work balance and patient care,but don't practice it .Administration is focused on money and not it’s people.Great hospital but leadership is poor. They do not understand how to retain or recruit staff. Work life balance is bad since we are chronically understaffed. Pay is not competitive for the position and benefits are terrible.Great HospitalBad administration, pay, benefits, scheduleVery nice place to work,Some of the employees are not very friendly some act you are a treat to their job, and of course NOT every one is the same some are very helpful and welcome youavoid HRI don’t recommend taking any of your grievances to HR at Mayo Clinic. What they do is hear you out and start building a case against YOU if you are complaining about a superior. They will find somehow your failt in the whole situation. HR is not there to help you but to protect Mayo leadership.I recommend taking your concerns directly to a lawyer, do not go to HR, they will ruin your career.Great Place & PeopleLearned so much at Mayo working as a PCA while in nursing school. Issues with staffing as there have been everywhere, but otherwise a phenomenal experience.Getting way too corporateMayo used to be a great place to work. No more. They're all about numbers money and the bottom line. They want more from you than you can give in one work day. Dumping multiple tasks on you that aren't in your job descriptionTeamworkI love working here :) everyone is friendly and helpful. Yes you have hard days but compared to other workplaces I would say this is pretty good. Everyone is helpful and teamwork is emphasized."

The commitment to diversity is important for Novanta.Work/Life Balance, Enjoyable Workplace Culture, No MicromanagingN/aStay awayThey have A LOT of employee turnover due to the horrible culture. Management provides no support, has no interest in changing and you'll be in meetings all day. You constantly get conflicting information on how to complete a task and when you need help, you get no response for days if you are lucky. They have no procedures in place, at least none that anyone follows. You have to access multiple systems to get info you need and the info is never correct.

I worked the cash register, so I was the first and last person people would see. In other words, I was the ""face"" of the business, if I provided excellent service, people would want to come back! I learned how to efficiently work a cash register, a little bit of Spanish, and a lot about Neapolitan Pizza! It was wonderful working with the managment and all of my co-workers, we all formed a great bond(inside and outside of work), and also worked very well together! I do not believe there was any ""hard"" part of this job, occasionally we would have an unhappy customer here and there, but I learned how to meet their expectations and make sure that they are satisfied! The most enjoyable part was working with my wonderful coworkers, and also with customers! It was great seeing customers come back, and also new faces, but either way they were always very excited to be there.2 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Good lower level team membersWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Quality is bad & management is not trustworthy.

Pavlov Media Inc,"Decent workplace, weird managementYou have a boss but your boss has a boss who is sometimes your boss whenever they decide to be the boss that day, once you get in your groove and understand what you need to do, it’s an easy job with the potential for a lot of hours. Monday-Friday 7-5, very great PTO system and decent benefits.Productive and fun workplace!I love working for a company with a relaxed work environment, but everyone's focused on getting the job complete at a high level. We share information and I'm never unsure about what needs to be done next.Can be an alright job but depends on where you're working.If you're working on the ccg side of the buisness you're either making good money hardly working or no money somewhat working. If you're on the Pavlov side you'll have the same issue. All of the managers make a lot of money despite half of them not knowing how fiber optics work let alone a keyboard. If you like a hard working job don't work here you'll be very bored most of the time. Slow months will be a lot of sitting around/pretending you've been busy.Terrible place to work.I’ve been there for about 3 years and they do not give you any training what so ever management sucks!

I'm a working parent and have a good work/life balance. There is always something to do and I truly feel I make a difference by working here. You need to have a forward-thinking mindset to be flexible to the changes that happen here. Unlike our competitors, we embrace change - and that's why it's incredible to work here. We aren't afraid, we have faith in ourselves, and have faith in the work that we do. Working formerly for a fortune 500 company where change to policies and processes were unheard of (and everything had a form), this company welcomes change it if it improves our products and services. The workplace is relaxed, yet focused. I like that I can wear comfortable clothing while I work.Because masks were hard to come by initially during COVID-19, the executive team MADE them for our employees to be safe. They eventually were able to purchase N95 masks, sanitizer, and accommodate those with health conditions. I feel safe working here.I have the best boss I have ever had in my career, who genuinely cares about me as a person, and provides coaching when I need it, but does not micro-manage. My boss is transparent in the company goals and initiatives, and enables me to execute them. I am given flexibility when needed, the tools to get my job done, and the space to do them in. My accomplishments are recognized which makes me feel good. I don't feel like a number here. I feel that my opinions and observations are valued and taken into consideration.

I truly enjoy working with them! The office environment is casual and allows you to build bonds that can extend outside of work.

They had really good vacation time. I just couldnt travel anymore due to my grandparents getting old and the rest of my family already moved out of IL.Company with great people, poor directionPavlov has an unusual culture. There's very little laid out in the way of expectations or policy. One thing we were reminded of often is that the residents at properties we serve were not our customers; the property owners were our customers and our job was to make them happy. If that happened to coincide with the needs of the residents, great. If not, the residents were out of luck.I can't stress this enough, the people at Pavlov are, for the most part, creative, intelligent, and great to be around. Unfortunately, they are also burnt out, without the proper staffing or tools to do their jobs effectively. Hiring and advancement practices are not carried out with the employees' best interests at heart, but rather the whims of upper management and a desire to get good talent as cheaply as possible.Great place to learn and hone your craftIf you are interested in computer support or system administration this is a great place to work. You will learn a tremendous amount very rapidly and have the ability to immediately apply what you have learned. If you are not interested in getting better at what you do this is not the place for you.Keep lookingToxic environment with unprofessional management.

People got ""promoted"" into newly-created positions, without their knowledge or acceptance. It felt almost like one was ""promoted"" just so he could watch you fail. And if you didn't ""accept"" the promotion, your current position was somehow magically no longer available. Promotions are also given based on if you are likeable. You come in to interview for one job but then you come on board as something else. The people who do the grunt work are wonderful people but they are so undervalued.Great co-workers in the trenches. CoffeeExecutive Management is so chaotic.Cutting Edge CompanyGood Place to work, if working in the field you will spend a lot of time away from home. Type of company that you can fill good about working for. Pavlov is using cutting edge technology.Terrible networkThis network consists of outdated and foriegn equipment that is always breaking. The management expects their customer service individuals to lie to the customer and act as management when customers ask for escalation. The management will not spend anything to better their networks or their personnel.Decent workplace, weird managementYou have a boss but your boss has a boss who is sometimes your boss whenever they decide to be the boss that day, once you get in your groove and understand what you need to do, it’s an easy job with the potential for a lot of hours. Monday-Friday 7-5, very great PTO system and decent benefits.Unorganized and Chaotic PlaceMost of the management was very helpful and enthusiastic regarding change and improvement except for Finance. Senior Management is not on the same page so there is a great deal of confusion as to what job duties consist of. If you are a woman, you could very well be offended many times daily. I found it to be a very hostile working environment. A real HR nightmare waiting to happen.Can't think of a one.No HR Policies/Standards192great modeli worked at Pavlov for 2 years, during that time i had great exposure to long, complex sales and had a chance to really make a differencefunhard work612Unorganized ChaosI truly hope that the company is doing MUCH better these days than they were when I worked there. The people employed there were great people that were passionate about whatever work they had to do, but anyone working management or above did not seem to be making sufficient changes to the company to invest in better-functioning equipment, make it easier for us to keep the customer happy, nor were the employees truly happy about what they had to endure because of the equipment that couldn't function consistently.The pay is good for someone just starting in the technology field, but there was little room for advancement unless someone suddenly left the company. Management had no plans to leave, but everyone else there did.As I said, this was years ago and I hope there was much learned and improved in that time.A fun environmentA great group of employees, but we often ran on a skeleton crew. Advancement was an legitimate option; they always promoted form within.AdvancementLow pay, and skeleton crewsTeamwork, enjoyed working with staff everydayWorked closely with contractors and technicians to make sure we were delivering a top quality satellite TV and internet product. Managed the technicians on a daily basis to make sure scheduled service calls were completed and customers were satisfied. One of the challenges faced everyday was coordinating contractors outside of our company to get work completed in a timely manner. The best part of job was knowing you satisfied your customers and look forward to working with them in the future.Average company, interesting benefits, but very few options for advancement possibilitiesGood working environement, lots of interesting people, need some improvement in management.Decent workplace, weird managementYou have a boss but your boss has a boss who is sometimes your boss whenever they decide to be the boss that day, once you get in your groove and understand what you need to do, it’s an easy job with the potential for a lot of hours.

Very good.Worked here 11 yearsHPE is a great place to work with a great staff. They are quick to promote from within and almost always try to accommodate the employees. I started out in technical support and moved into non-technical areas and was always offered support. While there, I was underpaid as a female but they fixed that issue by giving me a 25% raise to get me up to par with the males. I was let go but if you get the chance, this is a great place.fair, committed to helping everyone reach their potential; great benefits and time off policythey fixed the biggest problem I had with pay disparities so its a non-issueNice people, bad career trackThe position I held at HPE was a low skill position, and did not feel like there was a lot of room for advancement. On the other hand, the people I worked with were nice and the environment was very laid back.No es una mala empresaOverall good, though not perfect. The organization had a very well managed method of service deliveryGood Workplace, no pressure/stress, easy goingStandup meeting in morningLot of tech stack to learnFair Management/peoplework life balance is goodno pressure/stressteams have tough people to manage with ( i think every company's teams like this)No stress/pressureprojects might be boring sometimesGood company with good benefitsGood company with good benefits. It can be challenging working with different people but overall if you’re looking for work it’s a good place to work.Good place to workStarted in 1997. Not a lot of room for growth. My boss was good to work for. He treated me well and was fair. Might have been the best boss I ever had.Great Work/Life BalanceThe Company cares about its employees and takes initiatives to keep people happy. HPE offers 6 months of paid family leave for mothers and fathers. Often a slow-paced atmosphere.Benefits, Work from home, Family LeaveNot much opportunity for advancementGreat company to work forGreat company to work for. Allows room for growth and education. Culture is evolving in a positive direction. Expect change so it will be a non issue when it happens.Good experience and resume builderWorking contract at HPE provided a supportive learning environment on a project with good exposure to different sectors of the business. There's a presence of the bureaucracy of large corp, but the separation of the assignment protects your anonymity in the politics.Healthy cultureHealthy working environment in Sillicon Valley heritage company - not many career advancements for younger employees, very senior teamsReelvant company strategyBenefits, ok salarysenior teams, not much focus put on enabling and training managersGood company but very slow growthOverall good company but career growth opportunities limited. company is got focused after Antonio Neri is become the CEO. But the company culture is still slow.Professional, inclusive, intelligent environmentWhile retired now, this was the brightest, greatest team to work with in my entire 40 year career. Focus on culture. Focus on diversity. Focus on challenging its employees.Compensation, Work/Life Balance, Challenging tasks.Market did not apprectiate the significance of all that HPE delivered.Work, Benefits, culture,Work is good. Precedure all is available in the system. Training depending who tech you and you get smart to learn for all people and the different people. All you need your notes. Name, date, shift, hour no matter who.Benefits for company good pay for hires, .but the company changed for staffing and the staffing paying low and the company don't hire the employees.okok, growing, good people, good pay, nothing else to say, poor job security, not as good as the ""old"" hp use to be, moving into artificial intelligence.good peoplejob securityNo complaintsThat job taught me a lot. I gained a lot of knowledge along the way. To this day, I have coworkers that became friends. Although there were a lot of ups and downs, the good out weighs the bad. Management is iffy. You have to be ready for constant changes.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?The very professional dynamic of employees in a fantastic environmentWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?I can’t recall anything really stressful besides one manager that I did not care for who I worked under.Hewlett Packard was a great companyHP respects their employees and treats them fairly. I had a fantastic manager. Unfortunately, my division was sold to Micro Focus. When that happened, things went downhill fast and their culture was the opposite. I would recommend working for HP if a job is offered.Great Work Life Balance, Bad Business DirectionThe work life balance is great. Salary is low compared to competitors. Business direction is poor, as I feel they are just trying to stay afloat. One executive compared the company to blockbuster. Every quarter/year their are layoffs. A lot of great Talent moved to competitor companies within a year.Corporate AmericaYou are a cog in a wheel. If you have a great manager awesome but you probably won't meet anyone above them. Huge corporation that knows nothing about the lower level employees.Great job and environmentPay was great. Management will give you the training needed to succeed as well as introduce you to the right people. They do a good job of de-stressing you with activities. Lots of paid time off!!Fond memories but would not go backI worked at HP for 11 years. My worklife balance was decent. I was able to volunteer with non-profits in a way that I could never do today. But the groups I worked in were slow to adopt new technologies and I was concerned that I'd never be able to get a job anywhere else working on dinosaur tech at HP. So, I left and never looked back. My colleagues were fantastic. I have fond memories, but I wouldn't go back unless I was truly desperate. Even then, I probably wouldn't go back.3 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?No one really monitors youWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Meeting the sales expectationsNot much advancement opportunitiesWork you to the bone and no training investment in employees. Manager have favorites. Coworkers are nice and office is nice. Men are advanced much more than women.Some flex work schedulePay, no career advancement or training opportunities.Politic plays a major role in what happensLack of transparency in terms of company objective and goals. Many times different departments work at cross purpose to one another. CYA seems to be the approach to responsibilityExcellent Work EnvironmentThe job expectations were clear. Team leads and supervisors were supportive and did a wonderful job explaining and communicating performance goals expectations.HealthcareSalary is mediocre.Management does not provide good direction. Compensation is pretty bad. Great team makes the difference. Company provide internal resources to learn but they are not up to date.The people aren’t bad but there is little to no support from others or management.Besides the lack of support, advancements are rare. Job security is non-existent. Every quarter there are lay-offs and annual reviews are based on grade quotas, not merit. Pay can be a little low in the industry and raises are also very low, if at all.Many of the people and a few of the mid-management are great.See aboveGreat benefits and pay but difficult to advance in careerI consider the Human Resources upper management top notch as the company provides very good benefits and shows appreciation for their employees. In engineering, the projects are challenging and industry leading. Job security is low and career advancement is very difficult. Projects are cancelled and work groups reorganized often. People are transferred to new positions based on past experience, not career aspirations. In some cases, people advance to a desired position only to have the position taken away when they are reassigned to a new work group. They end up starting over and doing what they used to do in their previous position.Holidays, vacation, pay, work-environment options (office, remote, hybrid), challenging projects, diverse and inclusive workplaceJob security, career advancement, and stress of project deadlinesGave me a window into another worldBefore working at HPE, I was with Microsoft IT. I learned more about IT in 8 years with HPE than 20+ years at Microsoft. That said, both companies are more concerned about their bottom line than anyone's work-life balance. Getting on a plane early Monday morning an maybe getting home at 2am Saturday is maybe someone's sick idea of work-life balance, but not mine. I did learn a lot about real-world customer requirements, though.NoneTravelFun Place to WorkI interned here and learned so much. All of my supervisors did so much to help me meet people in my field and learn more about my field in general. My manager was honest, open, and transparent and I always felt supported in my team.Great pay and no dress codeThe pay is good but be prepared to work until 1 in the morning sometimes. The work life balance is not there and it is hard to have family time. I do not recommend this job for single parents without support.Employees were considered costsVery stable environment but few opportunities for advancements. Underpaying employees in general, and the reason was salaries took the greatest part of company's expenses. What else would you pay in an IT consulting company?Great benefitsHPE is a great place to work with good benefits, however there are a lot of lay offs which makes it feel uneasy a lot of the time. Overall I have enjoyed my time here.Lots of opportunities, lots of red tape new headquarters is nice.Overall, pretty good...but teams are in there own space and hard to work across.Great for getting time off, pay is average/below average with the market--not market leaders.The culture is engaging and becoming more and more inclusive.HPE is a great place to work. The management team has a clear sense of direction and communicates that effectively. I believe HPE is starting to walk the walk from a diversity and inclusion perspective. HPE provides opportunities to train and learn new skills and technologies as well.Culture, corporate strategyStrategy is narrowly focusedNice people, but definitely a grindI worked in a support center, in-bound calls to our help desk for a client contracted to the company. The people at HP were nice, but the atmosphere was very corporate-- no surprises.Professionally and personally rewarding family-centric work environment.- Hard work- Frequent long hours- Manages multiple high-visibility projects- Stratospheric levels of both internal and external responsibility and accountability- Exacting personal standards of quality- Reinforced concrete work ethic- Goal-oriented professional development- Leader, peer, mentor, advocate, friendInteresting tech, but constant threat to job securityHewlett Packard Enterprise has really good server technology for a nerd like myself to work with, but the downsides of working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the constant looming threat of layoffs.I found it boring and complacent, but an easy place to earn a paycheck.My review is a bit different considering I worked for a company that got aquired by HPE. The culture at HPE was quite boring, unenergetic, and old. Wasn't something I woke up for and was excited to be doing. They paid well and was extremely easy to meet any expectations.Good pay, flexible scheduleNot an invigorating culture or work environmentCut the workers keep the nonWas a great place 15 years ago until people didn't matter. Multiple CEOs over the years driving in different directions. too much management without enough workers.PayBrown nose wins out over hard workersGreat job and environmentPay was great. Management will give you the training needed to succeed as well as introduce you to the right people. They do a good job of de-stressing you with activities. Lots of paid time off!!Great place to work with numerous opportunities to growI love HPE because my senior peers are always willing to help. Besides that, the company is big so there are lots of teams and interesting projects to work at.Great compensation Remote workVaccine requirement on site (you can get an exemption)No sense of directionI was at HPR for 11 years as part of an acquisition and never found a sense of purpose. Management did not give me a sense or direction and most days I didn’t know what my goals wereWork from homeJust didn’t have a clear sense of directionComplete product line for all IT needsNo set schedule as long as you get your work done, in sales at least. Very good ongoing training and product development. Culture is relaxed. Most difficult part is working with other divisions of the company. More about that below.Good pay, flexible schedulesMost difficult part is working with other divisions of the company. More about that below.HPE will treat you like famlilyGreat flexibility and benefits.Job Security/Advancement is great.Job Work/Life Balance exceeded expectationsThe most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.great place to work and great peipleGreat place to work and great people to work with. Everyone is helpful and provide support. The benefits are good. The management is very supportive.Good place to work, good people, pay should be better.A typical day at work is hit and miss. One day I may have 10 calls and none on others. There is always something to work on or improve.I have learned that although communication is key, not EVERYTHING needs to be communicated. No one needs a play by play commentary. Just work hard and get things done.Management is very much political.Workplace culture is completely all inclusive. HPE does a great job to make sure MOST groups are recognized and have a voice. They are very supportive and allow everyone to ""belong"" somewhere within the company.The hardest part of the job is probably the most common hardest part of jobs... working with different people with different attitudes. Some people are very open, honest, and friendly but most are pushy and self serving.The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to be involved and change and see change.Work life balance, time off for wellness, flexibilityPay is not very competitive- just high enough to make you stayGood pay, constant chaosWith all the acquisitions and then company separations, there is a re-org usually every two years. Lots of layoffs, or reassignments. At higher levels, a lot of power playing managers, people in charge that have zero experience in the subject they are managing, constant changes in management.CompensationLong hours, constant re-orgs and layoffsA Company with a vision but some difficulty executingThe company has a great business model with the GreenLake solutions but seems to be under staffing to meet the needed demands that customers have. I believe the executives have the employees best interests in mind when it comes to diversity, inclusion, and benefits but it does not translate once it reaches the front lines. I worked long long hours and the stress levels were such that I could not maintain a healthy work/life balance in my last year and decided to retire to preserve my health. If you are young, ambitious, with a high level of energy and enthusiasm this company could be the right place for you.Great people Supportive managers DiversityA lot of stress Work/like balance difficult to maintainHP didn't know what it was getting into with EDSI worked for EDS when it was acquired by HP, so became part of HP. It shortly became clear that HP was more a product-focused company not a services company (i.e. shutting down all offices for 2 weeks around Christmas/New Years: that doesn't work when we support clients around the clock).Good work/life balance in the positions I had; good technical people, but pay was lagging which was why I jumped ship.Good compensation if top performer and great WLB but slow career progressHPE takes care of you if you are performing great. WLB is amazing as no one pushes you to stress out and over deliver. Projects are medium paced and not demanding. Career growth might be slow if you get in a role that does repetitive work in legacy technology.great wlb. 6 month parental leave. nice 401k match.slow career growthLiked the roleI enjoyed the work I did here, however there were many people in the division that were negative. The negativity could make some situations toxic at times.Freedom to take days off when needednot a team environment. some people work really hard, and others don't. Management does not seem to care.Expectation is to work overtime with no competitionUnfortunately, a lot of lay offs, no replacements and staff are expected to compensate for the lay offs with extended hours. No work life balance at all. Upper management is disorganized and staff are expected to work all hours of the day and night to keep up with different time zones. Late nights, early meetings.Flexible with doctor appointments and good healthcare benefitsNo work life balance at allGreat people, very helpful and great management who listens to the employees' needs and also fun to work.Great place to work for and great people too!Great culture and when they offered the option to work remotely helped a lot with balancing personal and work life.Benefits are great.Great place to work while you are thereIt is a great place to work, but you will be under constant threat of layoff. Seems to be a pretty consistent 2 rounds of WFR per year, but while you are there it is a nice place to be.Pretty relaxed on PTOCorporate doesn't support those beneath them.Great people, great environments, but compensation is lowI like say that all the people I worked and the team members were very friendly and cooperative. Culture of the company is very good and the projects are well organized and well-documented. All types opportunities are for career development. It is a very good company but only issue is the salary.Another big corporation that only cares about shareholders.They laid off the entire facility I worked at. They really only care about quarterly profits and stock price. They talk about all the things they do to care for their employees, but they will cut you loose on a moments notice if it suits them.Don't work there anymoreNo EqualityOk place to work. Not enough pay for dealing with irate county members on a daily basis. Company bought out every two, three years. Workers completing supervisor duties with no addt pay….and temps make more than employees.KnowledgeHorrible healthcare, inbound callers are always rudeGreat workplaceI worked at HPE for many years, and they do have a great culture. Life balance is encouraged, and there are opportunities to grow. Unfortunately, these opportunities can be somewhat tedious to find but not difficult so you have to always be on the lookout or miss them.With that said, HPE does accomplishes a lot for their employees and I always felt that I was well taken care of. Fun place, great family and great careers.Great accommodations, good diversity, awesome cultureVery small windows to advance, job securityGoing through a notable transition to re-brand ourselves in the hybrid cloud spaceSlowly trying to re-brand as a hybrid cloud company which comes with some cultural and inertial challenges but also some excitement and buzz - will be curiously to see how this plays out performance-wise6 months of for maternity / paternity leaveminimal salary raises unless promoted which takes 3+ yearsHP Enterprise better than HPINeither company is great but Enterprise is much better now that Meg Whitman is gone. The company decreased 401k contributions and Giannou moved it back up but both HPs are not my diarist choi eNo Meg WhitmanNot growing"

Samsung Research America Internship,"GooodReally great experience working there, good peers excellent infrastructure and tech savvy guys, hopefully will get there back in future again. Good forAmbivalent Management at all levelsManagement, from the top-tier down, show little interest in professional personnel beyond going through the minimum motions. HR is a joke; all-hands meetings range from the most amateurish talent contests to fumbling presentations by executives and staff scientists and engineers who could have achieved better results by mailing in their pitch.After 4 years with SRA, it appears to me that the only thing the company is truly serious about is cutting costs without recourse to the impact this has on innovation and professional development.A good place to workI like the pace of Samsung: fairly fast but not aggressive. I learnt a great deal from the position.They have a great cafeteria: you can choose from a variety of good food and only pay half of the priceAdmin ExperienceBeing good at Korean is definitely a plus.As an admin you build a lot of connections with people around campus. It can be fast paced at times, but it depends on who or what team you support.goodGood place to work. Lot to learn. New innovations and challenegs. Good people and very helpful. Lots of activitues for interns. Good benefits and good work cultureA real high tech companyIf you want to work on a cutting edge technology, work here. Actively grasp the changes in the tech industry and you have the chance to work with smart peopleSamsung is one pf the best places for work!I love this company, the culture, the time, the kind of work they do,the way how they treat their employees with respect and the opportunities to progress in or out of the company depending of your status, (contractor or FT).This is a busy place for work but it will provide you a great gratification at the end of the hard work.One more thing, If you are an interaction designer, be ready to visit Korea if you work for CX lab.A+ company.–J.Very inexpensive breakfasts, lunches, this is a pet friendly place, free Gym, awesome commute in CalTrain, Shuttles, etc.not badAll I can say is that SRA is not a bad company, but not a good one either.

ITW Food Equipment Group,"Good place to workI loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.Good place to workSalary could have been better42Fun work place but understaffed as far as management for shipping department.The shipping department is very fast paced environment. They are not changing with thet times and growth of company, improving procedures. The original shipping employees do not share information and correct your mistakes and errors themselves, withholding information and training help. There was a lot of talk about revamping and updated but never got started while I was employed. It was just a bad time to start there.Fun and Productive Work PlaceITW is a great company. You will be given a lot of independence so you will need to know how to self-advocate. Management can at times be a bit disorganized.Good PayShort BreaksYou only get what you giveIn any work environment, you can only possibly get out what you put in. Unfortunately, compensation was never matched with the effort put in. I was constantly reminded that I was going to get a promotion, but it was just a carrot dangling on the stick many times even with perfect reviews. Perhaps if I stayed a bit longer, things would've been different.Management can be betterThis job change upper management too frequently. The pay can be better. If you’re a great worker they do not compensate more than other people who are doing less.Nice coworkers. Train well.ManagementPoor communication among managementIt's an easy warehouse job. The benefits are good. The hours are Ideal A lot of downtime while supply chain issues are happening. The benefits are among the best especially if you're single. Enjoy your downtime is all I can say.Good benefits, fair payPoor managementRevolving door for a reasonLack of participation from supervisors and management, who often lose their tempers and take it out on the team. No humility whatsoever, you are simply just a worker not an asset.Coworkers stick together as a teamPay, environment, no supervisor/manager is ever held accountableGoodITW has Quality Productivity and Good management ,the employees are happy people to work with and the facility is Secure and a has safe environment which makes you safe at work.The hard part was lots of walking with the hand Jack's pulling totes. Getting to know my coworkers and meeting people was good.Good place to work. What I did not like was coworkers gossip. But overall, good place to work. At meetings we got to talk about any problems if there were any.I got to move around, not just work one machine.Yes, short brakes.The quality team is underpiad and overworked. The management is a joke.Run! Dont even waste your time.Trainig is poor. Its a shift war.There is no clear communication and pure drama.I do not reccomend working in qualityat this company at all.Small like feel, great learning experienceGreat company with lots of areas for impact as an intern. Would recommend to a friend who is skilled in C++ and python, as well as embedded systems!!!Management is not the best like most warehouse jobs.I did enjoy working at Itw at times, however other times it was very hectic when understaffed and not all help out just make good workers work harderOverall, a good place to work. Good compensation and benefits. Good job on promoting from within. Work life balance is lacking.The ITW principles are critical to business success. I know that my experience here will serve me well wherever I decide to go. ITW promotes a culture of shared risk.beautiful head quarters with on site gym, cafeteria and walking trailspoor work life balanceDecent assembly job, nice break room, tries to give back into communityBeen here almost 6 mo. Learned my line and a few others. Overall nice place to work. My 2nd shift coworkers are great. Had my reviews. There is an overall company review going on now, pay adjustment in March '22. Not sure the avg % increase on those.If you hit goals, free lunch. Company picnic, coat options for Xmas, earn Pd time off w RR. Ins kicks in fast, can use some of your Vac before you have it all earned... Good BenifitsSomethings just don't make sense...Loved the people I worked with. Management/Leadership didn't make good decisions.Loved the people I worked with. Management/Leadership didn't make good decisions. Many employees left to figure things out on their own or pick up the pieces of the bad decisions.Great place to work. Allows you to be yourself and achieve your career goals.ITW is a great company with amazing benefits. Will allow you to grow if you apply yourself daily. Has multiple divisions with global offices that allows you to move if needed.Confused managementOk at best , very unorganized , no room for growth. People leaving all the time. Typical production environment. Would recommend only to people that have to do this.Tough job to learn if you’ve had no experience. But If you get the hang of it, it can be a pretty fun job. Coworkers seem to be pretty cool.Lots of people have been there 20+ years. So maybe it’s worth it , Most are very willing to help you out while you are Learning the ropes.If you get the hang of it, it can be a pretty fun job. Coworkers seem to be pretty cool. I’ve only been there six weeks, but this is my assessment.New hires get vouchers for steel toe shoes. Safety glasses, gloves etc are providedShort breaksEveryone was helpful from management to floor helpITW is awesome all we’re helpful and patient. Just show up to give an effort and your good. The benefits are the best I have seen in the area. The work place environment is really good. Give them a try you will fit in.Benefits, work environment, payNight shift, wearing a maskGreat job if you enjoy being averageNot a terrible place to work. Pay is decent, benefits are great though. Management has no idea what actually goes on out on the floor. Little to no room for advancement within the companyGreat benefitsGreat benefits but the hours are a killer when you're on your feet the whole time. Our facility is way too segregated and makes you feel excluded and looked down on even though you've worked there for decades. Also not enough technical help.Benefits and generally steady workLong hours on your feet and segregationGood place to workI loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.Good place to workSalary could have been better42Great CompanyGreat place to work. Employees at all levels of the organization are encouraged to volunteer during and outside of work hours. Great team environment as well.1Awful set upEngineering doesnt seem to truly take into account placements for presses that would actively improve or help make work do able at the rates management wants. After the last shuffle of equipment it seems no one put any real thought into placement. They just moved my work station as well as two more next to me about 30ish feet to the side and double the amount of presses aswell as personnel. What that ultimately means is entirely too cramped space for 5 to 6 people, with out all the tools and carts we need. On the upside we dont have said tools and carts so they dont take up more space.Paid lunch and breaksOnly get 1 15 min break and one 20 min lunch for 8 hrs of work, you only get 2 15 min breaks and a 20 min lunch for 10 or more hoursGood company to work for with good benefitsGood company to work for with good benefits. Often found that we had way too much work for the team to handle. Understaffed and expected to do the job of 3 people. Overall I had a good experience working at ITW.Flexible but no future careerManagement basically aggressively plan strategy without understanding actual situation. The company will simply kick you out if goal has not achieved either it was for poor too management or for bad employee performance.Management will attack you if they feel threatenedThe company overall is a good company but the management at ITW/Hartness International is absolutely horrible. If your not part of the buddy system them your not going to advance. If you ask for more training to be a better asset to the company that isn't going to happen. When you do get tired of all the lies and decide to move on then HR and the management team will talk as if they want to work to keep you on board but behind closed doors they will verbally attack you as if you were the one doing things wrong. It says alot about a company when they have most of the engineering team quit and go elsewhere along with alot of the other employees.The Healthcare is greatUnqualified people in management.No respect for hard working employees.Off shift supervisors are pretty good most of the time. Management needs to be respectful of the people that make the company run. There's very little room for advancement unless you brown nose. Off shifts get blamed for everything, while managment is very incompetent. Pay is average, benefits are good, management doesn't appreciate the hard work done by the floor workers. Very stressful work environment.3 breaks, decent benefitsMostly everything elseGood company to work forITW was a good employer. Most Everyone worked well together and they offered decent benefits. My coworkers were great. I enjoyed working there. Only planned on working a few months and stayed 12 years!Worked well as a team, coworkers helped each other and were nice to work withSometimes hard to reach production goals.ItwOK place to work. Not bad, not great. Very good benefits, as it is a large company - costs and plans are good. Very COVID conscious. Very hard working.Good pay in a laid back environment.Pay is great for the type of work. Very laid back place to work. But this company isn't without problems. Due to the relaxed pace most employees become lazy after a while and management does nothing to stop it. Know that you will follow a shift that drags thier feet on getting work done in order to pass it off to your shift is extremely demoralizing. This in turn makes it hard to stay motivated. Outside of this, most shifts go fairly smooth.Management on the other hand is less than helpful. Supervisors and leads rarely have the answer for most questions when you ask. Any help you would go to HR for is welcomed with either them not being in the office or given a 1800 number or website to go to. Dont expect much help.The only other issue is if you are on either 2nd or 3rd shift you will be there for a long time waiting for a first shift job. Unless you are related to a higher up of course.All in all, the pay makes it worth looking past all the shortcomings of the company.Great pay, laid back.Management, Overtime, Stuck on off shift for years.Career building environmentYou will have ample opportunity to test and demonstrate your skills, provide results for the your team. and build a success resume of accomplishments that will merit future promotional considerations.There is an opportunity to create personal success for yourself and your team, There are plenty of opportunities to meet people who can coach and build your skills, and management provides opportunities for you to demonstrate how you can achieve results.This is focused intensive work with little room for major errors, you have to be good at what you do all the time, you have to make tough choices in how to balance personal time with company, you always can take advantage of unique opportunities that will benefit you.Toxic work environmentIt's a great place to work some days and other days it has you scrolling the job feeds. Such a yo-yo atmosphere and 98% male make it very challenging to be a female here. Most of the current staff is getting ready to retire and the work is dumped on the rest, making it impossible. Current management is lacking and the future management isn't promising.Flexible schedule, paid breaksUnorganized, poor managementGreat structure and fair payThere were a lot of opportunities for advancement and there was a lot o comraderie amongst the coworkers that made it not bad to have to to work.Would recommend it to anyoneFree lunch during covid during 2020Short breaks uniform change which made it hard to be on timeDo not work hereYou will not be known or recognized for the work you do. You can do a great job and have great peer and direct management reviews but in the end it means NOTHING. Upper management in Michigan dictates who stays and who doesn’t. They are bean counters and cut off their noses to spite their face. The business has suffered great losses due to being managed ineffectively. Very sad. Lots of talented people worked there and there are only a handful more left.Upper management and HR; poor business decisionsGreat CareerA premier employer in the USA and abroad. Benefits are above average and plenty of advancement opportunities if you want. Highly diverse workforce and product lines.Great retirement benefits*80/20 sometimes gets in our own way of supporting others divisions.I work for my familyEmployees make the sacrifice daily, hot environment and poor working conditions, they preach safety after the fact. HR and office and plant management have no idea what’s going on in the plant and throw food at you from time to time to make you feel appreciated. Pay is good if you put in the years and effort, I work for my family and that’s why I stay.Health benefits.Poor upper managementDependsI could say a million things about ITW Pro Brands, however I won't get into it since I still work here. If you are not salaried or management then nit worth it to come her. Salaried employees are treated a lot better than hourly. There are few opportunities for growth. Managerial structure is the downfall of this placepartial work from home (temporary) option to choose work hours no weekends healthcaremanagement, salary, flexibilityGreat Company and Great PeopleLove working for this company! Our team works hard and plays hard. The company really works to understand the needs of their employees and implement change where it makes sense. If you are someone who is motivated to create their own career and is willing to work hard to get there, this is the place to work!The open communication from management.Co-workers are great to get along with.Company offers great benefits and competitive pay structure. Company offers great PTO and 2 weeks vacation on your first day of employment with no waiting period. Also health insurance starts on the 1st of the month after your start date. Great 401k Matching program. Uniforms and work shoes provide for free.Many great amenities, Such as free luncues. Free coffee at the cafeteria.Training needs improvement for new hires.FunGood environment to learn how to work, not to hard, high turn over rate, barely had time to think, would be better if there was better communication towards the employees and staff.Micromanagement, they ""talk the talk"" but it stops thereFirst, depending on the department, you may answer to more than one person and generally they don't communicate and it's a cluster. The culture is very corporate, but the guys in the warehouse are more down to earth, including a few supervisors. You will be expected to pick up everything you are shown during ""training"" and most likely you will fall short and get written up. Oh and don't be late, even a couple of minutes will be a write up. This place is staffed with a lot of Temps and there is a reason, the employee turnover is high. The benefits are great, and in all fairness there are some good people that work there, including a couple of the managers and they do have an employee appreciation day where the whole company has the day off and meet off-site somewhere fun.Great benefits, Occasional free lunch, Holiday gatheringMicro management, New management, no thorough trainingGood place to workI loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there.

This was the best time of my work experience with them!Yes and many great activities with family!Okay place to work Management ehhWorking here was lack luster at best. Even in my lowly role I could tell those in other departments were unhappy. People just clinging onto retirement or using it as a stepping stone.1It was an ok place to work atDid not like the shift, facility was clean, good vacation time, always had the holidays off, pay ok for the type of work.

They have great benefits. They would rather hire from the outside than inside promotion.BenefitsJust a sit down, don't talk, and do your work type of placeGreat benefits package and plenty opportunity for advancementI really enjoy my job at ITW. Location is perfect, hours are great,and the benefits package is generous. Advancement is achievable and encouraged. We often get free snacks and occasional free lunches. Overall I feel valued as an employee which I think is rare in most production work environments. My only cons would be that it is a loud work environment and you do spend the majority of the day on your feet as a Slitter Operator.Good benefits package, close to home, room for advancement, occasional free snacks and lunchesLoud work environment, on your feet most of the day, tediousThe churn continues on and on and onThey will use you until they can get nothing more out of you. They hire you in and tell you great things then somewhere in Illinois a decision is made to change a manufacturing process and people are laid off as if they mean nothing. This company doesn't care about people at all.Needed a jobThey dump you when they're done with youWorker friendly environment and hours . Very good place to workAwesome people to work with , they were very flexible with the hours , overtime if you wanted to work it . Pay was pretty good, overall , one of the better jobs I've had.Free lunches sometimes, could pick what time you wanted to come in, 5, 6, or 7 amShort breaks but they were paidBelow average pay, good benefits and poor communicationThe company always talked a good talk. No recognition for going above and beyond. Virtually no support from IT or HR. Had to function on an antiquated computer system. Poor job at communication the company goals, and did little to nothing to keeping the employees aware of performance standards.Paid Holidays, Health Insurance costs, 401K performancenoisy environment, dirty environment, no supportBadHardship I endured was bad. People around me wasn’t nice, would not take any kind of direction, help, they just said o yes , ok ya, that stuff didn’t help me, if I wanted to learn a new plc program I was told come back at 1am when they were close, and they yelled saying I wanted their job.Did get a checkBad peopleokay placeits an okay place to work..no room for growth. if you are lookin for any type of job to put on your resume or to get your career stated and get familiar with the corporate culture, the place might be a good fit for you.Woman during my time working there, were actively being hired.Regular working hours except during tax season which at that time entailed a lot of overtime. Fellow employees are enjoyable to work with for the most part.High turnover and expectations mid level positions. Greedy ITW Corporate has saturated management.Drawform was a nice to work at with perks & respect for the employee.Greedy ITW Corp. took over.No longer a person, just an ID # and a wage $.The facility is nice and so are the people that you work with.If they're not excellent, then move onto another company before they get you.Your co-workers are Fantastic, You learn to stick together, You have to in order to survive.Don't trust management, Tripled # of executives while cutting 50% of workforce with twice the Sales and volume of partsIt could have been a good place to work.I'm a former employee of this company first off. The pay and work/life balance was good. As far as recognition of your work really depended on who you were. Not to sound too negative as it's been about 10 years ago since I was there. This was the kind of company that operated on either you were one of them, or you weren't. The last 6 months of my employment there left something to be desired. I ended up resigning, with full knowledge that if I'd stayed, I would have ended up in the office getting written up again. Not a place I'd recommend to anyone.Free lunches and fun company functions.Favoritism for certain employees.The money was good!If you are looking for a place to slack off and just stand around this is the job for you. I dont know about the rest of you but I take pride in my work and I work when I come to work. But when I see younger employees constantly standing around,on the phone, jacking off, then getting rewarded for it, well all I can say is management has their priorities confused 🤔 Do you want workers or phone talkers?Will work with you if you're gonna be late.Pure laziness gets you far.Great if you aspire to lead a business, not so much for functional leadersVery little investment in R&D or technical expertise. Expectation is for constant reduction in overhead while increasing revenue. If you like the smaller business environment, you'll probably enjoy being in one of the divisions and you can create a diverse career for yourself if you move around the businesses. You will have to deal with constant leadership changes, however. Career advancement is focused on creating new GM's to run the divisions, functional leadership and advancement is more of an afterthought. Lots of great people to work with and a good working culture."
State Farm,"N/awas satisfactory, overall good job, wasn't much to do, just called recent customers to take surveys and find out why they cancelled their auto insurance policy1Fun Work PlaceWorking for a State Farm Agent is a fun work place. Not much help with sales training. You have to stay late to call clients. Benefits are expensive as they are provided by the healthcare.gov website. I also noticed that yo do not have job stability.Great startGreat place to start your sales, insurance and financial services carrier. Great training and some agents even pay for your license. The systems are constantly updating.Depends on the agentIt really depends on the agent you work for. The newer agents are a little harder to work for. Agents choose the commission structure some are more generous than others.It's a great learning experienceSome agents are greedyUnless you are an agent, you will barely make a living wage.The agent I worked for was a decent guy. The environment was laid back but the nature of the business is tough to swallow. Way too many agencies which makes it harder to sell, lots of cold calling, and the commission was a joke. Again, if you have aspirations of becoming an agent it might be worth your time, outside of that avoid insurance sales. You would be better off flipping burgers.Laid back, quiet office environment.Lots of rejection, low pay, limited as to what you can do to individually to be more successful.Just starting outGood experience so far, interested in SIU. So far, had 3 months of training and just completed my first month ""on the floor"". Enjoying the job so far, expectations are pretty attainable.Fast -paced jobThe company has a lot to offer (to the customers and agent) however working for an independent agent can have its pros cons, depending on the agent. The job itself can be overwhelming. I feel like team members/ agent staff are taken for granted and overlooked.Nightmarish politics, catty environment, constant upheaval.Every day is definitely different at State Farm. But not in a good way. You will encounter endless technology issues, and a day with a fully functional system is RARE. They couldn’t care less about the people who are impacted most by their politics, and only are concerned about the bottom line. Agents compensation requirements turn their agents into the most miserable people alive, and they no longer care about their customers. I’ve been with this company for 6 years, and every day I wish my building would be hit by a truck.Great company!Done sales for a LONG time and gave State Farm a try and love it! Work like balance is amazing and job is rewarding. Find you a good agent and your life will be better! Highly recommendExtensive trainingWhile the training is long it doesn’t prepare you for the workload. Even more tenured team members have to provide assistance after 6 months of training and say it will take up to 5 years to learn everything about the position to be able to do your work without assistance. It’s not really hard, just a lot to know about and you have to experience different scenarios in order to learn everything so it takes time. Compared to other major insurance companies the pay is pretty low. Benefits are good. Contact center environment which wasn’t disclosed until training. Company is very structured.Very stressful workload, pay can be rewarding if you’re a great sellerWorked for a state farm agent for about a year. Overall, workload was stressful, finding clients was tough. Pay can be good if you sell tons of policiesIt's okay, what you would expect.No problem with the company. It's decent work but unless you are prepared to commit your life to the company you likely will need to settle for a regular wage and look for better opportunities or self employment. Not a bad job though!Fun place to workIt’s a nice place to work. Very strict. Takes some getting used to. Managers are okay. Systems can be faulty. There’s money to be made. I would recommendGreatIt’s definitely a great work life balance. You definitely should get your p&c for this role. But other than that it is a great job. For entry level.:)Not a lot a room for growthThere’s not a lot of room for career growth in the agent’s office unless you want to become and agent one day. Also there are almost no benefits offered because you’re technically not an employee of State Farm.terrible to employeesthe commission splits are awful, you have to mainly sell life insurance to make any money. they try to sell you on the ""opportunity"" but getting your own agency is slim to noneProductiveGreat company managers are great and flexible in the hail reconciliation unit. Look forward to working daily. Claims can be stressful but you will adapt.Lots of room for salesBase pay is low. Quality of training dependant on agent you work for. Sales from life insurance policies are key for increasing commission and not focusing primarily on single policy sales.Yes and noNo benefits, must find a good agent to enjoy the company, as State Farm has become very political. An ever changing system. You finally get a hang of the updates and then their changed againSupportive team environment, but excessive overtimeI thoroughly enjoyed working with all of my coworkers. Everyone was so willing to help one another on claims. The managers were also super helpful and knowledgeable. Benefits were great. However, it did not seem like the company had an actual plan to ensure proper staffing. In my department. We were required to work overtime every single month for a year straight. There were segments working overtime since before COVID. One of the biggest things that really hinder them in getting adequately staffed is that their hiring process is far too slow for how dire their staffing levels currently are. I understand wanting to make sure you're picking the right candidate, but it doesn't need to take months.Great workplace environmentProductive and fun workplace, many opportunities for advancement. Thorough training provided. Plenty of opportunities for advancement in the company.N/awas satisfactory, overall good job, wasn't much to do, just called recent customers to take surveys and find out why they cancelled their auto insurance policy1Many good people to work with but highly stressful environment.There was a very high workload but not the necessary staff. Although good PTO, it was very difficult to get time off because it was based on seniority. There was definitely micro management involved in this job.Good Benefits.Lots of work and overtime is necessary.15 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Culture of office.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?We can get very busy which can be stressful when you want everyone to feel like their issue is the only thing you have to deal with at the time.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fun and supportive1Stable jobThis job is very stable. I work from home majority of the time. I love the flexibility depending on your team, the managers can be great when an office they sometimes have events for the employee.Great overall experienceMajority was spent on zoom calls or in trainings and at the end we were essentially just used as a call center. We were then told we would just have to do live calls for 5 years for the fast track to move up the ladder. Most of the other interns are not returning to this position.Remote Working but a great culture environmentA typical day at work is taking and making phone calls to establish auto liability for insured customers and claimants. Calls can be stressful because 1 call can take about 10-20 minutes depending on how many cars were involved in accident. Overall this is a good job to gain experience as claims adjuster.Nice people but just a numberThe people are really nice and the company offers a lot but you’re really just a number to them. And there’s a high turnover rate. Don’t really care about what you have going on in life as long as someone is there to answer the phone.Great BenefitsAuto ILR is a very high turnover department. Extreme micromanage. Unable to request the days off you’re needing, and hard to transfer out of ILR Dept.Do not work hereToxic!!run as fast as you can from this job. They do not care about employees, they are only worried about metrics and meeting numbers.

I’m sure every agent is different but the agent I worked for cared about her employees. The hourly pay was fair but the commission structures were sometimes unachievable and unrealistic given the little to no training. Have to be a go-getter and learn fast on your own but it was a good place to start my insurance career overall.

Management had some power struggles but that's typical with just about any company in corporate America. Overall in my department, every body was easy going.Productive workplaceKind employees with a desire to help you learn and reach career goals. The training was very clear, and the entire team was on the same page about our goals.Stressful environment and horrible managementVery low morale Especially in Claims..Leadership are not good examples, and some will play the popular game if u watch closely. Do not report issues to corporate because it will get down to lower management and they will find a way to terminate youGood benefitsHorrible management, under appreciated and micro managementAwesome companyMy training group was the last 2 start off with 100 hours of PTO and a pension. Great flexibility, easy to earn PTO. The company supports you moving up career wise. I'm on year 6. I've moved to other departments and now I have a mentor to move into tech next year. Would love to retire here.Easy workThe work is easy and fast paced. Your progress depends on how much upper management likes you which means you have to tell them about your personal life which is not their business.N/awas satisfactory, overall good job, wasn't much to do, just called recent customers to take surveys and find out why they cancelled their auto insurance policy1Overworked and underappreciatedState Farm is stuck in the past. The entire company is now numbers driven. Customer service is pushed constantly but so are your numbers. It is impossible to be great in both departments with the requirements requested1Full of stress and no time offI’ll start with the positive things. Salary is good, benefits are decent, and use of company vehicle is nice. All of that does not make up for how exhausted and overworked I feel. In addition, I never have time to spend with my 18 month old daughter. Sometimes you have to decide what you are willing to give up just for a check.2Workplace CultureAs a Claims Specialist in the Auto Property Complex unit I found the workplace culture to be a toxic and cut throat environment. The environment is mostly driven by very poor Team Management and complete lack of interest by Senior Management to listen to their Adjusters suggestions regarding improvement of the day to day and overall team experience.Great Company Small ProblemsState Farm is a great company to work. Thought my experience they have always been rewarding and willing to lend an extra hand to get you where you need to be. Personal opposing views is why I chose to end my career with State Farm.n/athey will fire you as quick as they hire you. for absolutely no reason. they treat you like you are not human. they work you like crazy and you barely get any breaks. RUN!Good job but stressfulSelling insurance for any company can be hard especially nowadays. It’s constant selling selling and selling its very important to reach goals consistently or management will be all over you. Very stressful and overwhelmingOkay could of been betterMicromanagement gave me very bad anxiety, could of been a good career once getting the hang of it but management just was never satisfied, constant changeExtreme micromanagePros- pay, and the benefits are really goodCons- extremely micromanaged. I don’t like how you literally have to work likes robot and if anyone says differently they are clearly lying. You must stay active every 45 seconds and if you don’t it sends an Alert to your managers computer.Hybrid benefitI think that this company has good benefits I agree that the 12 plus training is intense I just started this job and it is basically a call center answering calls about claims all dayHybrid, PayjShort lunchEasy work environment, cold calling is stressful at times as you are calling people that do not want to talk to youCold calling was the worst part of the job, agents are hit or miss.

Barrier Companies,"Poor management, no paid time off or holidaysPoor management, project manager was terrific, lack of work between projects, lack of information between management and field technician, preference for field technician to assignment projects, Poor scheduling, you never know what will be the next step because nobody said nothing! In conclusion Poor management.Company benefitsHealthcare, company perksBest job I have ever had in the ""construction"" businessI loved this job. Great people and nobody breathing over my shoulder. There is a lot of autonomy.This job is 100% travel, which isn't too bad except for having to deal with airports and airlines.Overall very great place to work!If you want to make good money and get to travel around the country on the company’s dollar, then look no further and apply. Just come to work with a positive attitude, a will to work hard, and a open mind to learn new things and you will do great within the company. If you take pride in your work and have a good work ethic mentality, this is a place where that won’t go unnoticed, you will be rewarded for it.Paid Travel, Per Diem, Good Pay, Growth Opportunities1Steady workIt is a good place to work and steady work with 40 to 50 hours each week. Most of the people are good to work with. I knew some of the trades when i was hired but they taught me other trades too. Good company and good managers.Glad to be a part of the team.Moved out to Kansas before Covid hit and was lucky enough to land a interview with this company. During the interview it just felt like the type of place I wanted to be at. Great culture, stellar office setting, great people, and bosses that are involved.Amazing break roomCan’t think of any at the moment.Good experience and good companyI worked for this company for about 2 years. When I started my only experience was landscaping and farm work but they saw that I had a good work ethic and gave me a chance. They taught me everything I needed to know. I had a couple of good raises while I was there and was given more responsibility too. I learned a lot about how to work in a hospital, around patients, and about fire safety. The company cares about doing a good job for the customers and they care about their employees too. When I had covid my coworkers and even HR checked on me every couple of days. I was paid well and on time every week. They paid for the employees insurance so that’s a good benefit. It would be better if they gave vacation time but we could work enough when we travelled that you could take time off without pay and still have enough money. They were pretty flexible if you had something you needed to be home for so I could always get home for family events when I needed to. I really enjoyed the travel and the opportunity to see beautiful parts of the country but after a couple of years I was ready to set down roots and be home more. They have some local offices and jobs that don’t travel but I had an opportunity to do something different. If you are willing to learn and work hard and take pride in your job you can have a really good career here. I have nothing bad to say about this company.Great place to workGood place to work with good management. It’s not a huge company so there is not as much structure in the training and reviews. It’s on the job training. You get feedback on the job and raises are good and often at first and then slow down when you start topping out. I like it here.The good I the pay, they pay on time each time. I had no complaintssGreat company ethics, believes in their employees and you NEVER AHVE TO WORTY ANOUT UOUR MONEY. You also feel secure with your job and they promote inside, which is greatly appreciated,Good pay, great medical coverage and promoted quickly once they see your work ethics.They don’t give you enough notification about your travelingGreat place to workGreat coworkers and culture. The employees take pride in the quality of their work and making the client happy. The team works together to get through issues when they come up. HQ is just a call away to help guide you through whatever comes up.Ok place to workThere’s a lot better places to work the only cool thing is travel but 7/10 ur going to a small town in the middle of nowhere. They play favorites and sometimes you don’t get to use a rental carTravelLiving with random people that are dirty, poor management, play favorites, lots of slackers that just hide in the ceiling and smoke vape pensGreat place to workBarrier is a great place to work. Management really seems to care about the employees. If something goes wrong on the job they do their best to make it right or make it better. In the past crazy year with Covid and so many people losing their jobs I am so thankful that they have kept me working as much as possible and I am excited for all the growth planned for the future.Excellent place to workThis company is a great mix of small company culture but bigger company benefits. I've seen many hard-working employees get multiple promotions as the company grows. The Owners are great and so are the coworkers.Great coworkers and growth opportunitiesProductive and stress free workplace with great peopleEveryone at Barrier Companies is very nice and helpful. Nobody is ever worried about asking other employees/management questions. Everyone is great with working as a team to make the company better and also helping other individuals strive for greatness within the company.Good company with steady workI work in hospitals all over the country doing inspection and repair work on fire doors. I usually work about 50+ hours 6 days a week and then go home once or twice a month. I have a chance to use my carpentry skills and face a new challenge and learn something new on almost every job. We mostly work in crews of 2 or 4. I like most of the people I work with. The hardest part of the job is sleeping in hotels full time and it's tough when you see hospital staff and hotel staff more than your own management because the job is fulltime travel. And the flights are not always good. Some of the coworkers are great and some are not but it's like that everywhere I guess. It's nice when we get on a long job in a good area and you get in a routine and explore the area on the weekends and it feels like a normal job. It's good pay and steady work. I worked in construction before and this is a thousand times better because the work environment is clean with heat and air conditioning and nice people. The best part of the job is when I get to know the hospital staff and they compliment our work and want us to come back or give us more work so we can stay longer. I like making them happy and making the company look good.Good pay. Steady work. Sight seeing. Benefits.I love BarrierI started in damper inspections several years ago. After some time I was rewarded with progression through the various scopes of work. I was able to move to the field manager position for door inspections. Every organization that I have worked in has felt like I was still in high school before this company. Every organization before Barrier made me feel like I was unimportant. I used to feel like I was in some type of Dilbert cartoon.It has been a privilege to work in this company. For the first time in my life I am happy to answer the phone when my boss calls. I actually go out of my way to visit the office with this company when I would avoid anyone I worked for in other organizations.Barrier is a rare place where praise is actually handed out as often, if not more often than negative items. I can actually give my superiors my ideas and criticism without fear of retaliation. I have actually had calls and emails to tell me that they appreciate me.Before I started at Barrier the idea of enjoying a day at work was something that I expected once a month. I can say that I like everyone in my section. I have the privilege of working with professionals. I can actually trust those who I work with, and work to earn their trust every day.I would recommend this company to anyone who is willing to put in the work required to be a part of a team. I plan on staying with this company until I retire.excellent culture, wonderful supervisors, great teamshealthcare, full time travel, must be self-motivatedVery goodBarrier Compliance Services is a very good company to work for. I like my Superintendent and my Foreman and most of my coworkers. No layoffs and good benefits.great company and good raisesI have worked here over 2 years and have learned a lot. They trust me to teach the new guys and plan our day. We work in hospitals so it is a really good environment to work in. Every week is a little bit different so I am learning new things all the time. It's not hard work but sometimes there are tight places to get into. I've had raises almost every 6 months so they do take care of us and we have good benefits to that the company pays for. I like that we get to meet new people and see new places. I wish they had paid vacation time but most of the time they let us work overtime for a few weeks to save up and take time off if we want to.pay and benefitsBarrier TechnologiesGreat company to work for. Fair pay, offered travel, good training and hr department is very good at handling any issues that may arise. Would recommend to anyone looking for career employmentManager was nice, but few coworkers were not.A lot safety issues to be fixed at the hospital, not sure why they downsized. Management was easy to work with, but some of my coworkers were not. Sad to lose the job,good companyIt is a good company. The work is pretty easy. Most of the foreman and crew leads I work for are good and I have learned a lot. My manager knows a lot and teaches us something new every time he is on the job. I wish they had paid vacation but the other benefits are real good.AvoidGreat pay for the work. Hours are steady and guaranteed. My time with this company seemed promising until about the 3rd week in. Company claims to give on the job training, they do not. They will send you to a seminar to get certified but will give very little hands on training. If you're looking for a temp entry level job theyre great for it. Long term career prospects as a technician are minimal. The project i was assigned to had been going on for a year already, even the most senior traveling employees in terms of time with the company hadn't been with the company longer then a year.Poor management, no paid time off or holidaysPoor management, project manager was terrific, lack of work between projects, lack of information between management and field technician, preference for field technician to assignment projects, Poor scheduling, you never know what will be the next step because nobody said nothing! In conclusion Poor management.Company benefitsHealthcare, company perksAlways an open oppertunityBarrier was a phenomenal buisness to work with, from my perspective I was always taken care of either by coworkers or management in the field or office any time of day or night. Barrier was a great advancement in the sense of adding tools to my shed and acknowledging those who strive to put forth the effort, there was always something to learn and plenty of opportunities for moving up in the company if you took the time to learn and study anything in your path and applied it to the specialized scope of work they perform.Barrier overall was very generous in all they do and provide for not only their customer but for the employee as well.Great benefits, 401k, pay advancements, insurance, flexi3Lots of travel33Good employer who treats employees wellI have worked here over 5 years and I have worked a lot of other companies too. The company has grown and changed a lot over the years. They have always treated me well and if I ever had a problem, I could talk to the Manager or HR and we worked it out. Some of the younger guys here expect everything to be handed to them, but if you work hard, Barrier really takes care of you. I don't have a single bad thing to say about them.24Love my jobChallenging and fast paced everyday. I have the ability to research and try new things within my job. I’m always busy and challenged to create new ideas to solve problems.Work life balanceNonegood companyThey pay fair for the work.

They taught me the job and I advanced in pay. The job is 100% travel, with only one trip home per month and that takes some getting used to. They were always flexible with me whenever I had a family event that I needed to attend. They were really understanding when I had some family emergencies. Ultimately I had to leave because of changes in my family life, but they treated me great the whole time. My manager was great. He really cares about each employee.steady workAt other construction places there are busy times and slow times and you never know what your pay will be each week. I like that this job is steady work and I always get 40 hours or more. Like everywhere I have worked there are good people who work hard and have good attidue and there are people who are not happy and complain but I like it and the managers like me and I think they treat everybody fair and better than most places. I wish they had vacation and sick pay but most other construction places dont have that either. They pay is good and they give raises so Im happy.recommended it to my friendsI like my job. Every day is a little different. What I like most is the satisfaction of planning and reaching goals with my team. I came into the job open minded so that I could learn and do what is needed. I've been here 4 months and I just got promoted from entry level wall repair technician to inspector. I've already recommended this company to some of my friends.good environment. good pay. they recognize hard workgood pay and good benefitsReal good pay. I get to travel and they pay all the cost.

I didn't have any experience and they taught me everything. I mostly do caulking. My boss knows a lot and takes his time to teach us stuff every week. At least once a week we have a team meeting and he tells us what we got done and what we are gonna do next and he tells us the hospital director is real happy with our work. He takes time to brag on people for doing good work. Managers from the office in kansas come out sometimes to talk to us and tell us what a good job we are doing. I never worked a job before that does that. A couple people quit for a little more money but they came back cause it's better here.Benefits. Pay. Good bossNo face to face management, and if you any good be prepared to work hard and get no recognition, one of the worst if not the worst life safety companyWork on the road performing life safety services in health care facilities. Management which is in Kansas will believe anything supervisors say without asking you. Work your behind off and you will get no recognition, enjoyed the scope of work but very awful companyNot really to much, at first the travelMonths on the road and when ask for home time you’ll paint a bullseye on your backGood if you have no other options or do not know any better.It is unfortunate to see that a company who does not abide by federal laws still attempts to deceive its new hires with empty promises. I have seen wrongful terminations, complete, discrimination, and racial remarks made by supervisors that you are often in the field with and can not go to HR because you will be the one who is fired.Management and scheduler seem to panic when things get a little busy and will relocate you in the middle of a job to a completely different state, mind-you without pay during your scheduled work week. Almost like they have never heard of a schedule before. Did I mention that flight will probably be 8 hours or longer. I have never once seen management try and get their hands dirty. Its an environment which thinks they are better than you are because they are in an office. I will quote a manager when you ask about raises and or bonus for making them money, ""you will see it on the back end"". I am still owed.TravelingBuddy system, favoritism, High school office mentality, wrongful terminations, good for people who do not know any better.Great place to work and advanceI have a job where I travel all over the company. It is fun to travel around and see different parts of the country and learn new things. Sometimes it's hard to be on the road that much, but mostly I love it. The company is growing fast and they sometimes hire lazy people who only want to complain and some of them get too many chances but the company will eventually get rid of them and I'm glad about that. There are a lot of great employees who work hard. I like getting to work with lots of different people. I'm learning something new all the time. If you work hard you can advance. I've been around about 2 years and I've had raises and I am a crew lead now and I am still learning but I get to teach new employees what I know.Unprofessional buddy system incompetent pettyThis company spends half there time reworking jobs that have failed they have taken on the buddy system a workers experience competence work ethic and quality count for NOTHING at barrier tech is all about who's your buddy .

Difficult work conditions, and outside most of the time in the elements.Decent place to workNo Paid time off, no vacation, tough work environment6Great Place if you like to travelI enjoyed my time with the company but I have a family at home that I was unable to see except on every other weekend.

EMC Insurance,"Good benefits, some areas goodA lot of burnout from too much change too fast and higher and higher expectations. A lot of changes needed but not managed well. Some areas have a lot of turnover which is telling. New manager promoted who is unqualified, several instances where toxic people are allowed to stay or manage, may be due to higher up friend or reference so don’t feel like you can say anything; this has happened several times. Often heard that this was not the same company anymore. New people coming in have all the answers and longer term less valued. Remote is nice but I don’t think it is best for culture, more disconnection and less teamwork.BenefitsChange burnout, some areas of management1Great companyNo micro management, very flexible. Promotions within. Good pay. Nice work balance life. Now fully remote. Very good PTO and medical benefits. Overall I would definitely recommend. They have recently gone through changes in corporate so things could now be different.Total failure to support employees by management and ITThe inept IT support and lack of training severely impede employees' ability to successfully perform their jobs. Lack of support and impatience of management add to negative work environment and overworked employees.NoneHorrible IT & systems - impatient and unrealistic managementFun work placeLow pending, management is great.

My manager is supportive. I enjoy the people I work with.There's a lot of changes going on in the company but I truly believe they are necessary.Going through way to many changes at one time.Company is trying to change everything at once, with very little coordination. Changes were necessary, but poorly managed from the top. Upper management says they are transparent, but they really are not, which leads workers to speculate.great benefitspoor change management, poor cultureOverallAntiqued system. EMC is trying to upgrade their system currently but now you have to work on three different systems still too much work and not enough pay.There is nepotism in the system. Unless you’re a favorite of one of the managers you’re not considered for promotion. A lot of managers and a lot of employees have left the company to go elsewhere . The only positive thing is the health insurance is good. My advice is not to work there unless you are desperate.Free lunchesSee above.Toxic and hostile work environment. MicromanagementThis company has went way down from when I first started. Micromanagers in some departments and no supervision in others for a great lack of consistency. They no longer care about their employees. Certain supervisors show favoritism and will tell lies on you to make themselves look good or to keep themselves out of trouble. They will ask you to speak up about things that are concerning you but in the end nothing ever changes but grows worse. I wouldn’t recommend working for this company now as the culture has turned toxic and very stressful. I felt forced to resign because management would not take it upon themselves to investigate issues with supervisors that should be fired or at minimum given corrective action.BenefitsCorporate, micromanagement, toxic work environmentGreat place to workHad a summer internship here. Loved every second of it!Management was super helpful and I learned a lot from my coworkers. Heads of the company care a lot about their employees.Flexibility, great benefitsGreat BenefitsThe benefits at EMC are great! Lots of PTO and great insurance. The work/life balance is also pretty good. You can work remote when needed. The pay is something to be desired though.Pto, insurance, 401KPayNeeds better middle managementManagementToxic environment with co-workers that management doesn’t want to address.OverallTop executives are great leaders but not involved with day to day management that affects the overall morale of the individual contributors. Will take a lot of conscience effort to change the culture for new team members coming in.Solid Company. Don't just look at the checkPay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at EMC Insurance are better than most. Especially the medical insurance. The coverage is like having a second job. I have almost no out of pocket expenses.Great Place to WorkI really enjoyed my time working here. The pay and benefits were excellent. The hours were great as well. It allowed me to maintain a good work/life balance.Pay, Work/Life BalanceNoneAwesome CompanyGreat place to work, every company has their pros and cons but for the most part EMC has succeeded my expectations. The company is very big on work place balance.Good company to work for but not a lot of room for growth and little payLittle pay with no room for growth. Good culture and work balance though. Management was okay but there were a lot of changes happening which is why I leftExecutive Admin ReviewThis was the best job I have ever had. The culture, the benefits, and the people are second to none. It is a large employer and I was on the executive floor, so I didn't have a lot of interaction with those outside the executive level, but everyone I met was wonderful. They helped me learn, and they learned from me. The administration was stellar and the job was challenging. The pay and benefits were the best I've ever had. I was so sad to leave due circumstances beyond my control!Great environmentI loved working at EMC I was able to grow professionally. Great job environment along with much volunteering options. Great place to work! Management provided ""family like"" environment.Very team oriented. Strive to succeed. Treat employees very well.Lots of meetings to say focused and on top of schedules and appointments and what needs to be done for the day.Have consisietent learning classes to continue education. Be open to communication with your reps, UW,s and insured to set up apptsBe open to cronstructive crisitisim.Be open ans curtious to your bosses and leaders. Be openSatisfaction of confirming an appointment and going over goals and figurig out what you excell at.When people are absent it creates a bit of back up work but nothing we cant handle.EMC is a good company for underwriters in the insurance business, for accounting they took us to part-time. We are always wondering about job securitFor the accounting part department is not a stable environment they are trying to go paperless and eliminate the branch accounting and do everything from home office which is located in Des Moines Iowa. We have no remote access to work at home like everyone else in the company. Even though we work part-time we get full-time benefits.Good benefits, some areas goodA lot of burnout from too much change too fast and higher and higher expectations.

Fantastic benefit package free covered parking and onsite cafeteria and gym. Great place to work and growGreat benefitsNone!favoritism & micromanagement abound!Overachievers beware! This is a great company w great benefits. It seems like an awesome opportunity until you realize how the management actually operates. If you are not a favorite, you absolutely will not progress regardless of your hard work and extracurricular activities. You will not be given a fair shake. You will be left feeling stifled, overworked, and unappreciated. Thuswhy their turnover rate is extremely high.great benefitsantiquated management styleGreat benefitsEMC has great benefits and great culture. Comfortable working atmosphere. Opportunity for advancement. Great work environment. Great management/leadershipGreat learning experienceEMC is a well established company with job security. The environment is fast paced and always changing. Everyday is a new learning experience. My only complaint is that there was too much nepotism (sisters working with sisters, spouses working with spouses, parents working with children).Lots of meetings with great food!Too much favoritism and clicks.SentGreat place to work with many opportunities for advancementI started at the bottom in the claims department and worked my way up to Claims Specialist. On the job training. Great culture. Lots of job security.Undergoing changeThe many changes are rooted in IT. The top 2 tiers of leadership are new and overhauling the entire platform. It's good and bad as you might expect. Expectations might be set a bit high, which could lead to disappointment. Long hours are to be expected for quite some time.Nepotism at its finestLack of diversity, behind in technology, not keeping up with industry standards for salary and benefits. Most employees are related to each other or has had a family member that has worked for the company. Hiring family and friends who are not the most qualified for the job. Work from home is for a select few and at most two days a week. Lack of accountability for employees for make sexist and racist remarks or break company policies.Good Local Professional Insurance CompanyEMC provides great insurance and takes care of their employees as well. This is a company where if you work hard, you don't have to (be part of a clique) to be accepted or move ahead in the company.Pay, Benefits, CultureSmaller Company, could be hard to promote.Great jobSteady work great environment great employess good environment great pay flexiable hours family orentiend work is easy if you can follow directions fast pacedGood benefits, very conservative underwriting philosophyWe had good products, mostly very good agencies to work with. Very nice office location. Underwriters were somewhat micro-managed. Too much emphasis on making things fit to computer programs. Not much trust of underwriters to think independently.Excellent benefits and pay.Local management didn't let employees do their jobsAwful accounting management, no securityMy internship did not go well. Thank God I started a job the same day they let me go. My manager would listen to YouTube videos all day, but made it a big deal when he saw me listening to my own. He fired me after I told him how it was hard keeping track of what I was doing because he would just walk up to my desk anytime he wanted. They keep hiring interns because they want to save money and not really invest in people. This is how management gets bigger bouses, by not sharing. Most people working there have either been there for 10 years or longer, or have had family members work there in the past or even currently. They make interns believe there's a chance to get hired, but that's not very likely. I was given a mentor who sat right behind me, but never even said hi or checked on my progress. The job consisted of a manager who micro managed, but did not know enough of what he was managing. He hardly knew anything about the processes in my job. I would ask him a question, and he'd go ask someone else every time. It made me uncomfortable how much he would just pop up at my desk with no warning, interrupting me when trying to learn new things, he'd also ignore me when I told him I wanted to learn new things.What made me the most uncomfortable was how much everyone would ask each other personal questions just to find out info about them, andd WOD then tell all that person's business. There were alot of people who had worked there a long time who could do things that others couldn't, like using the company's phone for personal calls, and I mean everday.Good peopleQuick paced and very repetitive. Management new nothing about printing or bindery just pre press so we're in the dark alot.. overall was a good and fun place to work.AmmenitiesMGMT. Not knowledgeable about their jobs.A good stable work environment with good benefitsI enjoyed my time working for EMC as an analyst there, and would work there again if the opportunity presented itself. Unlike other companies I have worked for, the work/life balance at EMC is great, and seldom found myself having to work outside of normal operating hours. The company, despite being large, still had a ""family feel"" to it, as you could easily encounter upper management and executives eating in the cafeteria with the other employees.That being said, this was also a bit of the downside of the company, as it did seem to keep them a bit behind the curve regarding IT advancements and business process philosophy. This feel leaves them a good 10 years or so behind standards of their peers in the industry. If they can find a way to catch up on these areas without losing their soul, they would definitely be a full 5-star company to work for.Great work/life balance, good benefits, encouragement of further educationSomewhat outdated business processes and IT platformsIt was so long agoIt was so long ago. I took the tests and had a great interview. The people were so nice and willing to give me a start with their company. I did not have a lot of experience but they gave me a chance.Stable and secure companyEMC is a great company to work at. They recently started offering flexible work schedules and offer fabulous benefits. The culture here is great and I enjoy coming to work everyday.Lack of management addressing employee concernsManager chose not to address employees excessive absenteeism, blatant rudeness toward other employees and inappropriate conversations in the work place.BenefitsSupervisionThe company and fellow coworkers were some of the best.EMC is a wonderful company with great benefits. I would consider it to be the best insurance company around. The job responsibilities were varied so being bored was not an option!A Great CompanyAs a Manager within the corporate structure, I was given flexibility and latitude to do my assigned duties and to adhere to not only the needs of the employees under my management, but more importantly the needs of our Clients.Work environmentReally have no consGood benefits, some areas goodA lot of burnout from too much change too fast and higher and higher expectations.

I haven't ever worked for a more fair employer. The management is truly wonderful and supportive. It is a demanding career field but you are well compensated for your efforts.Unlimited career growth potentialBored out of my mindI have no idea why I was hired. The amount of work I was given everyday took me about 20 mins to get done. The other 7 1/2 hours I just sat in a cubical reading a book/newspaper.I was never given any projects to work on like some of my female coworkers were, and I was told a couple of times its because men screw everything up.Great Benefits, Free Parking, Free GymNo advancementWork enivromentGreat place to work.

Never a dull moment you are always laughingEliminated entire insurance line 6 weeks after hiringBeen there six weeks and today they announced they are eliminating their personal lines division and they didn't need 122 personal line jobs anymore. I'm pretty sure they knew this 6 weeks ago so not sure why they pulled me from an unstable company which is why I was leaving just to have this happen after 6 weeks.GoodEMC although using an outdated programming language is working towards more modern (c#/.net, agile) methods to move their company forward and overall was a good place to work.so far it has been greatI have not been at EMC long. so far it has been a great place to work.

The job title that was posted oddly truthful and misleading at the same time. However, I do appreciate the company, and my supervisor is amazing, the amount of time off is ridiculous -- in a good way.Comfortable EnvironmentLearned a great deal about large building maintenance and management.

There are some interesting and challenging projects that come through the shop that I worked on. Most of my coworkers were fun to be around and there were lots of company activities, at least prior to COVID-19. If you can handle lots of poorly communicated last minute changes after working many hours on a project, then this place is for you. My job felt too much like a guessing game after a while.Free lunch Friday, fun co-workers, company activitiesPoor communication, Poor organizationCool Projects, Terrible Management\Culture/PayGet ready to feel like just another cog in the machine that is DI. They will pay you peanuts and trying to get a raise is like pulling teeth. In the meantime they will hire new blood with almost zero experience and sometimes very little knowledge and pay them more right out of the box. It doesn't even matter if you are super flexible and perform other duties outside of your own hired ones. They. Do. Not. Care. Want to take some time off to have an important surgery? Rest assured it will be held against you. Want to be suddenly unemployed without warning? Good news! If you work there long enough, and by long i mean a couple of years, you will be a witness to the great DI purge if not a victim. Last one was in 2018 and purged 30+ employees. Have the drive and moral and talent to spare and want to have all three drained from you systematically so you are left with nothing but a fleshy husk? Then sign yourself up bucko. Heed this warning. Look elsewhere.HrmmGreat place to work for. Shame I had to leave when I did after my father passed away. I really liked it there. They catered towards employees and their comforts and lifestyles, etc..great place to work,management was never on the same page.I learned a lot from this company. the organization of the company was difficult! the employees there was al very qualified for their jobs.

They choose to under pay employees that do more work. I am a professional automotive painter and started painting for them to over work myself/ get hurt/ never appreciated any one that did the real work. Only supervisors get the credit and get bonuses for standing around talking to friends while you bust your back for little money. I don't recommend Dimensional Innovations as a job.cool projects to be involved inunder paid, favoritism, unappreciatedExciting work environment, team oriented, attention to detail, perceived care for employee well beingThere really wasn't much I can think of to complain about with DI, I loved the culture, I loved those I worked with and the opportunities were seemingly boundless, they went out of their way to try and make us feel needed and appreciated. If there was one area I could point out that was lacking to me it was upper management although polite & seemed to genuinely care about employee morale their actions didn't particularly match up often times though they listened to our concerns and suggestions, those things seemed to go in one ear and out the other, they seemed to pay lip service to us but there was little follow through. I have a very hard time giving a negative review but another area I really have a hard time with is understanding the mass layoffs that occurred that lead to my termination, in estimation there was over 40 employees sent packing and from what I've heard through the grapevine all over town this is a regular occurrence with DI, that's quite disappointing to hear. DI is an amazing company, they have amazing people, amazing culture but it seems their Achilles heel is poor financial management, their excuse for laying me off was an error in annual projections for the upcoming year. I'm no business guru but bad financial projections shouldn't be put on the shoulders of the lower end employees who work hard daily to produce the products they are selling to their customers if someone poorly projected financial numbers for that year, that should be on that person's shoulders and those involved with estimations and bidding of jobs. Overall I love DI and I hope theyLots of perks, fun after work activities, pleasant culture, fun environment, creativeLack of oversight in certain departments, miss management of financials, attentiveness to employee concernsPoor cultureManagement is only concerned with what the clients thinks. Will do anything to please a client even if it means over working the employees and losing money on a project.Great people work thereThose great people end up leaving because of the stressFast paced, cool projects, stressful, little room for advancement, and little to no compensationWork and build some cool stuff but upper management doesn't seem to care much about its production staff.

It's really fast paced, and demanding at times. Generally the co-workers are pretty good people, and are a large part of why I work there. Management is okay; there are definitely worse managers out there. Per haps the biggest short coming of DI is their reputation to pay at sub-standard rates and raises do not come easily or often. The company has invested in growing and capital improvements, but they do not re-invest in current employees, in either continuing education or raises. Employee retention of top talent is something that is an issue for them and will continue to be so until their philosophy changes with regard to re-investing in their current employees. Overall it is a good company, with a few changes they could be a great company.Nice work environment & facilities.

Lots to learn and create and be a part of!C suite is disconnected from boots on the ground, and they’re in danger of destroying an amazing cultureExciting projects with absolutely no opportunity for advancementDimensional Innovations prefers to hire shop floor staff by first forcing them through a temp agency, with promises of rapid hires for the right candidate. Many temps wait months, or up to two years to be hired, regardless of performance. Once hired, many promises are made about advancement, but are almost never kept. Even when an advancement plan is shown in writing, the plan is diverted, and the employee is given ""just one more test"" to prove their worth. This continues until the employee is beaten into submission, or quits for one of the many better paying alternatives. They lose incredibly large numbers of good employees, who help maintain a positive work environment, with these policies.Most employees are paid well below the going rate for their job description, including engineers being paid at 75% or less of the industry average. The upper management makes certain to regularly let the lower level employees know that they are not appreciated by keeping a strong divide between those employees who get dirty for a living, and those who stay clean. DI is known for asking hourly employees to clock out for company events, which are scheduled during normal working hours, and then telling them they can earn back their missing hours by coming in early every day, regardless of their personal family situation and scheduling requirements. Salaried employees are given no such requirements.The Chief Financial Officer and head of Human Resources has been quoted as saying, ""I never thought of hiring from within."" The upper management is a group that got together with a muchWonderful lower level employees, interesting projectsLies about advancement and raises from management, very little job security, forced temp agency hiring prior to official hiring314The company works on very cool projectsI feel like the company does important things. We cater to several large, well known clients so to work there is a badge of honor of sorts. The majority of people I work with are very good at what they do.

They will pay you peanuts and trying to get a raise is like pulling teeth. In the meantime they will hire new blood with almost zero experience and sometimes very little knowledge and pay them more right out of the box. It doesn't even matter if you are super flexible and perform other duties outside of your own hired ones. They. Do. Not. Care. Want to take some time off to have an important surgery? Rest assured it will be held against you. Want to be suddenly unemployed without warning? Good news! If you work there long enough, and by long i mean a couple of years, you will be a witness to the great DI purge if not a victim. Last one was in 2018 and purged 30+ employees. Have the drive and moral and talent to spare and want to have all three drained from you systematically so you are left with nothing but a fleshy husk? Then sign yourself up bucko. Heed this warning. Look elsewhere.HrmmGreat place to work for. Shame I had to leave when I did after my father passed away. I really liked it there. They catered towards employees and their comforts and lifestyles, etc..great place to work,management was never on the same page.I learned a lot from this company. the organization of the company was difficult! the employees there was al very qualified for their jobs. The company never used us to our full potential,the saying"" too many chiefs and not enough indians'!well compensatedexcessive travelingGreat projects to be involved as a team to create and build.Great job if you don't mind being looked down on because you didn't go to Kansas University or any major college. make much not expect to here. They choose to under pay employees that do more work. I am a professional automotive painter and started painting for them to over work myself/ get hurt/ never appreciated any one that did the real work. Only supervisors get the credit and get bonuses for standing around talking to friends while you bust your back for little money. I don't recommend Dimensional Innovations as a job.cool projects to be involved inunder paid, favoritism, unappreciatedExciting work environment, team oriented, attention to detail, perceived care for employee well beingThere really wasn't much I can think of to complain about with DI, I loved the culture, I loved those I worked with and the opportunities were seemingly boundless, they went out of their way to try and make us feel needed and appreciated. If there was one area I could point out that was lacking to me it was upper management although polite & seemed to genuinely care about employee morale their actions didn't particularly match up often times though they listened to our concerns and suggestions, those things seemed to go in one ear and out the other, they seemed to pay lip service to us but there was little follow through. I have a very hard time giving a negative review but another area I really have a hard time with is understanding the mass layoffs that occurred that lead to my termination, in estimation there was over 40 employees sent packing and from what I've heard through the grapevine all over town this is a regular occurrence with DI, that's quite disappointing to hear. DI is an amazing company, they have amazing people, amazing culture but it seems their Achilles heel is poor financial management, their excuse for laying me off was an error in annual projections for the upcoming year. I'm no business guru but bad financial projections shouldn't be put on the shoulders of the lower end employees who work hard daily to produce the products they are selling to their customers if someone poorly projected financial numbers for that year, that should be on that person's shoulders and those involved with estimations and bidding of jobs. Overall I love DI and I hope theyLots of perks, fun after work activities, pleasant culture, fun environment, creativeLack of oversight in certain departments, miss management of financials, attentiveness to employee concernsPoor cultureManagement is only concerned with what the clients thinks. Will do anything to please a client even if it means over working the employees and losing money on a project.Great people work thereThose great people end up leaving because of the stressFast paced, cool projects, stressful, little room for advancement, and little to no compensationWork and build some cool stuff but upper management doesn't seem to care much about its production staff. Production is held to tight deadlines and is very stressful at times. Very fast paced. Little room for advancement and sub par compensation for the stress and skills required for the job.Best Co.

Intense timelines and travel requirements unsuited for a family-man. I have no more to share...................InnovativeI loved seeing the new and challenging jobs that I got to work on. I enjoyed problem solving on an ongoing basis. Raises didn't happen as often as they should have. The little appreciation that was given was never aimed in the right direction.favoritismfun place to work forNice place to work for,must people are nice good pay nice place to retire from,always busy never run out of work to do,it is more then just welding!you fit cut and take measurementfree lunch once a monthgreat health insurancevery fast pacedok place to work, did not like traveling.Enjoyed working with my hands, I was involved in the fabrication of some really cool stuff, check out their web site.Cool projects, substandard compensationWe work with some high profile clients on some really cool projects in the Sports and Theater industry. It's really fast paced, and demanding at times. Generally the co-workers are pretty good people, and are a large part of why I work there. Management is okay; there are definitely worse managers out there. Per haps the biggest short coming of DI is their reputation to pay at sub-standard rates and raises do not come easily or often. The company has invested in growing and capital improvements, but they do not re-invest in current employees, in either continuing education or raises. Employee retention of top talent is something that is an issue for them and will continue to be so until their philosophy changes with regard to re-investing in their current employees. Overall it is a good company, with a few changes they could be a great company.Nice work environment & facilities. Exciting work / projects.Sub-standard pay, low end benefit package, demanding.Productive and fun place to work.Typical workday is 7am to 3:30pm. You get one break in the morning and a thirty minute lunch. everyone was great to work with and DI has a lot of fun activities.Free Lunch FridayShort Lunches"
Oracle,"Great benefitsThe benefits are amazing. And that is where it end. The pays sucks when you are hired on, no raise for a long time. Your coworkers can be rude to the point you don't even want to come in.Benefits, some nice peoplePay, no growth really unless you are buddy buddy with management, people can be rudeNo transparency and my entire department was laid off with 1 week’s notice.Oracle has no care for the employees it spends time on training, investing in, and entrusting with their sales pipeline. I worked remotely on the sales team and most of the time we had no idea what to do or there wasn’t any work to be done. Oracle’s own software barely worked most of the time which made it nearly impossible to do the job when there was something to get done. My department of 200 people was laid off with a week’s notice. Stay away, there is no job security at all.The fun perks and working environmentThis was a great company to work for. I was very happy! My co-workers were always extremely helpful with great attitudes, and that is a huge factor for me in a working environment.Management was always very encouraging and didn't Hover over you all day. They give you the trust and confidence to go about your day. They were always quickly responsive anytime I needed any help.Oracle has a very fun and relaxed working environment. They have fun games and activities built into their walls. So you could be getting up from your desk for a much needed break! and walk down the hall and start playing the electronic basketball game on the wall, or race cars on the built in race car track. etc. They have foozeball and ping pong tables in the break rooms, with Amazing! views of lady bird lake. From any break room on any floor. They have ""quiet rooms"" where you can go to take a little 15min. nap on your break, if you'd like.Oracle goes above and beyond to make sure their employees are happy and stress free on a daily basis. Because, lets face it. Every job position can get stressful. No matter what kind of job you have...so as a company they really understand that aspect and they created an Environment that MAKES you WANT to go to work everyday! Which i believe is a huuuge! benefit.Also we all know that Food! is what get us through our day, each day. They have an amaziiiing cafeteria! with over 7 different types of cuisine stations.

I felt like I was part of a massive machine where they didn't value your opinion or try to get better. It's impossible to make a change at this organization and any time you try you will be met with resistance from management. Oracle is only interested in doing things the way they have always done things. They talk about innovation but are really slow to actually start innovating. They are more interested in managing their way to profitability rather than innovating their way to profitability.Good benefits, some groups allow you to work from homeHard to get things accomplished. Top down management style.Good work-life balance but bad compensation and lack of growth opportunitiesOracle offers good work-life balance, but raises are rare and when they do happen, the % increase is horrible. The company does not offer a clear path to develop and make a career with them.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Your peers.

From the moment I enter the client's site I'm busy working until early evening.Good place to learnEnjoyable time there, but left when project was done. Middle management was very good, but upper management left a lot to be desired. Turnover made the role difficult in regards to focus and prioritization.Great Design CultureAs a designer this is a fantastic place to work. The organization has really prioritized UX in the product development process and is pushing hard to create consumer grade experiences for enterprise applications that are typically boring and cumbersome to use.

The company has an amazing culture. However, prepare to work many hours and under pressure.Poor management.In the group I was in the management was very very poor. Product goals were not articulated. Group meetings were very rare. Project Managers were not helpfulGood work life balance, great medicalnothing goodnepotism, discrimination, abuse( including verbal).. management is horrible. they are proud of mistreating people .. this is experience in the IT field.

Huge make or break when working at Oracle. One person in the same position can have a totally different experience as the nextIt was Ok! But could had been better. ThanksI was a contractor so we did not come first, but the job was not hard. The people where nice. Management was slow to react to some maintenance needs. In my opinion, poor communication or inept management. I just got tire of waiting and wait if and waiting. And then all at once they want it all done at theist minute. Not well organized and just plain ridiculous, good thing we are not making vaccines or batteries. It was just maintenance no big deal I guess. Let it fall to the grown it needed to be replaced anyways!!! Lol.Nice people over all.Not enough growth potential.Great team, horrible compensationThe management is really supportive of UX Design but Oracle is a dinosaur tech company so promotions are rare and compensation is trash (they will lowball you, especially within the GBUs). They have great benefits and time off though. Depending on your team you might end up with a good manager or a bad manager - I had a great manager. I met some great people and learned a lot about enterprise products but ultimately there was no sense of career growth/ path. I also realized most people do not stay here long so at times you might have a lot on your plate leading to burnout. Overall, Oracle is good to have on your resume and good if you are looking for job security but not career growth.Brutal chaos built on toxicity and abject degradationDeveloper-centric culture with zero accountability at all levels. Unless you are a developer, you won't actually get to do what you were hired to do. They give it to a developer and just put you in charge of gatekeeping them, which boils down to pouring coffee for 300+ adversarial developers for every 1 of you. Consequently, there's nothing to measure you on but your subservience. The smart people leave and who's left are zombies who complain they don't get raises. While mid to lower leadership is generally supportive and understanding, they, too, are victims of higher leadership. Like a bunch of children, higher leaders are inept, constantly fighting each other, changing directions on whims while disallowing questions for clarity, and instead micromanaging your work to a period on a sentence (no lie). You're constantly pushing the boundary on ethics, that is, doing the right thing vs. pleasing some VP in the sky. If you don't believe me, check the customer data they collect. It's abundantly clear that leadership choices are bad, and, no surprise, you are prevented from acting on the data. You end up in an emotionally-charged culture living in fear, so it's hard to get close to anyone as they think you'll throw them under the bus. It's a pity cause it could be a great place to work. The benefits are great for a company that size, the unlimited PTO is a real life-saver, and remote-first is a dream. If you interview with them, do ask about accountability. Then make the choice right for you.Benefits are great; remote-firstChaos, micro-managing, and blessed nonconsensual actsCool huge unstable companyThey laid-off thousands of employees last month. But, this is not the first time it happened in this company.It seems that if something goes bad (recession, bad management, restructuring based on geo opportunities, investing in a new industry, pandemic, etc) the work force is the first variable to cut.Purposeful environment with good leadership but mediocre systemsGreat people and strong leaders with a lot of knowledge and purpose. The technology is also great. However, the training could be better and the compensation does not add up to what you expect.Alright place to workThe biggest pro is the work life balance and room to grow within the company. Oracle can be a great place to work depending on management and what team you work for.Hard place to workAs an industry sales rep, it was difficult to get all the resources you needed. Still leads by product sale, not overall solution.AWS seems to have them on the run in cloud services.poor review of experience from those with limited skillsI am happy to have the experience and happy to move on. This company has real talented people, but a few individuals made the experience tough. Those problem people let the experience and their position go to their head. Those doing the hard work with long hours went unnoticed.travel and global experiencespeople with poor job experience were a strange mix in HR coupled with real talented peopleDon't Drink the Kool-aidAs a BDR you can do everything right and still have your commission shot because of selfish or unprofessional field teams. Countless mundane zoom calls and Excell sheets will constantly eat into your day. Bizarrely, all daily tasks must me hand logged (you would think Oracle could automate this?) . Commission is capped, internal structure is all about how Woke and compliant you can be. As a professional hire, I would never have imagined this massive company to have such a poor Business Development program, but it truly does.Great place to start but difficult to progressOracle is a great place to start your career but career progression can be difficult even though the company emphasized the importance of it. Pay increases are very low and it can take years to move up. I learned a lot and grew the most here though.Great work group because of my team leaderI’ve enjoyed my yrs at Oracle because of my manager who is well respected because of her expertise. Despite this our positions were eliminated. However I have been offered another positionOpen for all walks of life. Fun place to workMy experience at Oracle was long lived and full of things to learn. I became a Spu Chef in no time, but after a few years of hard work, my health didn't allow me to continue my journey. I appreciate everyone who helped me with the transition and will never forget what this company did for me to prepare my fight with CancerDon't expect much upward mobilityFavoritism is the language of the land here. unless you get in good with people that matter, you are just a grunt. get comfy, you'll be entry level for the long haul.Pay is OKunless you are a major suck up, don't expect the job to take you anywhere.Worst companyExtremely arrogant people! They don't appreciate the hard work you do and they don't care about you. There is no work life balance and almost no opportunities to learn and grow.NothingLow salary, No work life balance - Arrogant peopleWork life balance is great, compensation is not.I really enjoy my work. I can choose my projects to some extent and I have a good mix of work with reasonable deadlines. The culture is pretty supportive and open. However, Oracle will not pay to retain its expertise. It would rather lose knowledge and skill to keep payroll down.Cannot recommend oracleRuthless company culture with no regard for the employees being pushed to their limits, there are exceptional people scattered across the company, but in general it is all about the bottom line and the unlimited vacation policy is a bad joke, it just means there is no vacation balance to cash out when you are laid offGreat benefitsVery demanding cultureHit or missIf you are in the right organization with the right territory, it’s a fantastic place to be. Resources are overbooked and it can take a long time to get SEs aligned. Overall it is a good place to gain experience.Do not plan to advanceOnly way to advance is to either have connections at the top, or graduate from a prestigious college. Do not expect any annual compensation at lower level positions, all fiscal monies go to management, although if asked, there is no money.Benefits are fairManagement does not careDecent benefitsPretty much live at the whim of upper management without a clear understanding of the future direction. They keep buying new companies without a clean plan to integrate themBenefitsLeadership keeps changing course without waiting for the last change to take holdGreat benefitsThe benefits are amazing.

The manager is supportive, but this is an average company.A lot of customer support or on call task that take our energyLazy place to workIf you have goals and you want to actually work towards them Oracle is not for you. Leadership is always changing over and most sales orgs here are incredibly disorganized. You success in this role is dependent upon your relationship with your fieldGreat company but if you are downsized good luck getting back onThey relocated our positions to Mexico and gave us severance. Have applied for over 80 level one positions that I was more than qualified and still no hire back.work from homeStress, lay offsJob responsibilities based on projectsAs a functional consultant you must have enough billable hours and certain certificates to get promoted. You learn as you go and you'll never know how to do your job 100%great work balancelow pay and too much is asked for to get promotedGood employees, horrible sr managementIn my 10 years at Oracle, I received 1 promotion with very small raise, no pay increases and nothing but lies from management about promotions or advancement. Good employees with great work ethics, but not worthy of the company. If I could buy the company, i would fire all the SR mgmt staff. After 8 years, we were told that our jobs would be lost to Austin Tx where wages are much lower. I finally quit 1 month before being laid off, but denied my entire severance package!!!Company policy showed higher pay differential for night shift, but company changed the police after our shift ended.Good health care and free drinks.Horrible management and NO PAY INCREASES !!!Never know when the ax will fall. Minimal pay increases so you lose over time.There have been multiple rounds of layoffs over the last few years. People with years of knowledge are let go with two weeks to find another job internally. No transfer of knowledge. Existing staff needs to pick up the work. They have been bringing in a lot of outside managers who want to replace teams. Ultimately the customers get hurt. And for years, there have not been pay increases. So much better to leave and start over with better pay. Benefits of medical are good because they underwrite the insurance so it's cheaper than most. Unlimited vacation time means you get nothing if you need FMLA and nothing to cash out if you leave.Good professional place to workA lot of different business units/products. Oracle competes in every segment of cloud - saas, paas, iaas. Encourages internal mobility but expectation is you already have requisite skills/experience for the new job, so can be difficult changing business unit. Good work/life balance. Oracle competes in so many different segments can br tough to be best of breed in any. All of Oracle's best products tend to come from acquisition, innovation fairly slow within.Single-Minded Pursuit of MediocrityNo salary increases--ever. After a few years of no increase, you will need OT in order to simply survive, and they make it harder and harder to get OT approved.No job advancement. If you like learning about Oracle Cloud, then there is a ton of training. If not, not so much. No promotions. Internal transfers are basically impossible.This company had so much intellectual property, and they threw it all away to go with commodity cloud competing against entrenched competitors. And they wonder why they are struggling.Employees are forced to use clunky tools (that they claim are ""modern"" like Fusion Cloud and CPQ) and beta test them as part of their normal job. And other (usually APEX) internal tools that were designed by monkeys which don't work because they were never thought out.Limited growth and advancementPeople are good to work with, but no real growth; no salary increases or raises. Every move internally is lateral. New hires get paid more than existing long term employees. While they offer educational training and certifications, that has it's limitations for some people. It's not as easily obtained as one would expect.Company reputationOracle is a very good company to work for depending on which department you are in. The call center not so much. Very little room for growth. Degrees are required for other areas.Working for OracleVery little room for growth in certain areasGood work environmentGood work environment, training, and opportunity to learn. Bad wouldn’t hire me full time. I was told when hired I would be converted to full time, but after two years they didn’t. I believe that’s the job market not necessarily Oracle.Opportunity to learn and grow.Wasn’t hired full time like all other contractors.Good work/life balance; terrible annual compensation changesGood work/life balance; terrible annual compensation changes.They claim to support internal transfers, but the process is cumbersome and don't allow comp changes when transferring.Unlimited vacation with manager approval though. And the overall benefits (health, eye, dental) are fantastic.Unlimited vacation with manager approval; everyone gets Christmas week off; great benefitsCompensation changes just don't happen. Raises are infrequent and trivialProduct ManagementThe best thing about working for Oracle is the ability to change careers within the company. They will provide the training and hiring managers are highly encouraged to consider internal candidates who are looking to career change!Career opportunitiesLots of home built tools - some unfortunately very buggyExcellent CompanyExcellent Company t work with.Good ethics and work life balance.Good pay and managementExcellent opportunities to work in newer technologiesEmployee friendlyIt's a REALLY BIG company, so there's a lot of different worlds out there...As my team is isolated and new, so it's hard to apply the same rate to the company as a whole, since there's so many different teams and BU to work with. But mine is just a nightmare in disguise... they take advantage of third world countrie employees for global roles and you just end up being paid REALLY unfairly for the amount of work and responsabilities. There's a reorg in place now, so be careful.5 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?If you are driven, there are ample opportunities to learn.Colleagues and stakeholders are very helpful and understanding. Some will ask tough questions which I think, is a great way to learn and grow.Amazing work-life balance.Lots of focus on helping employees up-skill.The senior managers are the most wonderful folks I have worked with.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Processes at Oracle often seem tedious and that can be frustrating but I suppose, that comes with working in an organisation that is as big as Oracle.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Respectful & inclusive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A lot of learning from senior managers and leaders.Do not recomend. Very stressful and low pay. High turnover.It is a sweat shop. Turnover is extremely high. They squeeze you and throw you out. This is a quote from a coworker. Also look up Francisco Oizzari burn the boats. This video was shown as a motivational video. Shocking.3 starsWhat is the best part of working at the company?Great salary and benefits for full-time employeesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?The bureaucracy at this company can disenfranchise creative people. It's hard to do anything out of the box or innovative because garnering corporate buy-in is near impossible with the layers of approvals and soft opinions.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's very corporate. The culture is stale and quiet.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work from home or in an empty open floor plan office. Lots of emails and company meetings.Do it for the nameIf you receive a job offer from Oracle, accept it for the name. The huge name looks great on a resume & is worth working in a beginner sales role for a year.The role is pretty much a glorified administrative assistant role. You are not selling anything but a meeting so your sales rep can pitch a product.The 3 month training should focus more on understanding the technology rather than the basics of selling.When it comes time for promotions you'll have no issue getting a higher sales role, but if you want to switch LOB's it will take a while. HR says they hire internally, but I haven't witnessed anyone being hired into a different LOB. There are ""internships"" you can do called rotational roles where you get paid the same salary as BDC for 6 months while doing work for the team that adopted you. After 6 months the team decides if they want to keep you on board or not. This is the easiest way to move to a different LOB within Oracle, but it still takes a decent amount of time.Overall the company outlook is good, work life balance is great, & I had a decent experience. If you're looking for long-term sales then this is the job for you.Cool offices, great work/life balance, decent pay if you hit your numbers, week off in between Christmas & New YearsRoutine, not great base pay, hard to move internally, some managers micro manageCog in a corporate machineOracle is a corporate environment where you are explicitly a cog in a machine. You do your (often minimal) work, get very lucrative bonuses, and are operate in a sales environment that is focused totally on getting the next meeting. It isn't a bad place to work, but one that doesn't prioritize your knowledge of the product or how you solve customer pains, it is focused on selling and selling only. Which at the worst times can feel deceptive and pressured, and at the best can be uninspiring."

After moving into QH corporate I moved in and out of various roles, ending up in my final role. A typical day was fast paced, but not stressful. QH is a process-based organization made up of teams, which work with other teams to ensure that nothing drops through the cracks. Ownership is a part of all roles. The hardest part of the job was switching gears on a moments notice to ensure the customer was first in both a perceived and real way. The easiest part of the job was knowing there were others in my team that had my back. QH gives its associates the tools and training to get the job done.2Poorly Managed.The only thing more toxic than the chemicals you deal with, is the Management/Work culture. Very little transparency, double standards concerning attendance/conduct policies. Inadequate tools, no appreciation for wok performance, below average pay. New production operators get a $1000 sign on bonus. Maintenance gets $0. Do yourself a favor and find something better.Descent schedule, Long breaks.Poor pay, little room for advancement.2Ambiente laboral tóxico y trato inhumano con demaciado preferitismoEs una empresa no comprometida con sus trabajadores, mintiendo y despidiendo a su fuerza laboral injustamente, como empresa contratista no hay estabilidad laboral ya que trabajan por contratos y si este llega a expirar se te despide y te da lo que ellos quierenA once great employer, now a place to avoid.I used to love working here. After a large company merger a few years ago with a company that was miles underwater in debt, we have started to adopt their poor procedures and have lost interest in doing the right thing.The turnover rate has become alarming. They've recently raised the new-hire salary so much that experienced employees with years of service are making less than those that walk in the door and only work long enough to get the sign on bonus. Employees who have spent years sticking their necks out and have had the initiative and skillsets to receive promotions are only making as much as these new hires will by the end of their first year.Great place for new hires. Terrible place if you plan on exploring an actual career opportunity.Unskilled labor, Can be picked up on easily.Terrible management in the recent years, Constantly changing procedures to ones that often backfire and fail.Working remotely has it's rewardsAs a contractor I found the work rewarding and plentiful. Team members and management were really easy to work with. The pace was fast. The work was not difficult but extremely detail oriented.FlexibilityWork life balance is not the best for a contractorCould be a great companyThis could be a great company. There are great people who work hard in the organization and want to do all they can to ensure it is successful. However, they only like to promote the leaders to higher leaders and bring people from the outside to promote to leaders instead of from within like they boast about.Exciting FutureGlobal company that is very matrix management oriented. CEO and corporate leadership team are excellent. Growth opportunities exist for all skill levels.Work / Life BalanceNoneThe work is not to hard, the pay is descent if you have experiencethe management is easy to work with, the work is not extremely hard, you work at your pace. The pay is descent, not above or below average for the chemical industry. Not very much advancement but the yearly raises and gains have bonuses are nice.workhealthcareGood people to work with.Good people, Ok pay, good not great benefits. Fair time off and sometimes O/T but nothing too serious. You get what you put into it.free lunchnoneHardworking employees, poor upper managementVery hard to advance unless you have a PHD. Most managers are generally good and accommodating to flexible schedules. Company emphasizes safety. Good place to start out. Company claims they want to improve employee morale but doesn't do the things necessary to achieve that goal.Flexible schedules. Good 1st level management.Increasingly taking benefits away for lower level employees, Hard to advance without a PHDThe chemicalsI liked it well enough. I will advise anyone looking for a career, they should pursue it with this company. I learned a lot as where i could possibly train someone on this job, and I learned to respect the hazards of certain chemicalsLots of Opportunities for Professional DevelopmentI’ve been given lots of opportunities to grow professionally. However, the amount of independence in making my own stamp on processes is pretty limited. At times, I don’t feel energized about my work and the days can drag. The work life balance is great, and most of my coworkers are helpful and team players.Work Life BalanceNot feeling energizedGood place to workGood place to work, hours are good, pay is good. The work is challenging and there is always something different to do on a daily basis. Overall satisfied with the companyBuild your resume and move on to a better placePay and benefits are mostly competitive. Company corporate HR does not have good crisis policy planning. Nice people, but you have to play hardball with the company's management of you want a fair shake. Great place to build resume, but corporate management does little to indicate they want to keep you for the long run.Great for favorites, others driven outStarted out good: the cafeteria, the flexible hours, some sense of autonomy. Once they decide they want you out everything becomes very rigid and nitpicky. Got clear signals to watch out even though my work ethic never changed. But the cafeteria is great!Not worth your timeCompany culture has been and continues to deteriorate. Don’t have the right people or right leaders to build a company to be proud of. So busy working to check the box that they’ve combined Quaker and houghton they have zero interest in how those changes impact the people. These is no “soul” about creating a solid employee focused workplace,, just those looking out for themselves. A lot of disingenuous people, egos. And when you leave, your treated even worse- poor communications, no follow up, backing out of commitments made.Keep looking for other opportunities.Decent benefits at decent ratesCulture, people, old school attitudeWas a great place to work until the experienced upper management retiredWhen hired, we had an outstanding upper management team. Upon their retirement, questionable hires occurred which substantially impacted sales and job performances across the board.New location with a cafe`Quaker Houghton has consolidated into one facility. There are many different facets in this company. The array of colleague knowledge is incredible. There is always something new to learn and most everyone is friendly.Decent starter jobThey give you training to be able get another chemical operator job but you have to sign a do not compete clause that's in effect a year after you leave. The insurance is god awful. The pay is good for starting off but you can often find chemical plant that start off at much higherEasy job, great crewThe atmosphere is very positive, and everyone gets along great. Management is strict, but then, I expect them to be. My boss is really nice, but he DOES NOT brook fools, which I enjoy about him, though I've been blamed for something that someone else did, but that happens. All you gotta do is just understand that management doesn't see everything, and if it's something you can fix, then just do it and go on with your day. He's fair, though, and isn't afraid to congratulate you on a job well done or if he thinks you have a great idea, which is RARE in my experience.caught in the middlewith the overall answers i feel caught in the middle, since pay was good, OT money was amazing, oh and benefits too, but the managment was at another counry and there was no safe place to preform, completly life hazard, not a proper laboratory.

There are times this model wasn't followed , however upon insistence on my part some obstacles were overcomeClean environmentsToo many selfish personalitiesHoughton InternationalSupervised the Federal tax compliance and SEC reporting functions for $900 million dollar specialty chemical company with operations in thirty countries.Houghton ReviewI enjoyed my time there, I was able to learn a lot of different skills in a short amount of time. I was able to do several different tasks and became good at them because of the number of tests each sample required. There was a good amount of office fun as each month we celebrated birthdays and each holiday was a potluck event. There were several competitions outside of work which were fun to partake in. The people were helpful and I gained a lot of experience at Houghton.Management does not assistThe company does not support the team just takes one person perspective.Be aware of management and support team. Tell you they support and act like they support but do not. Terrible work experience, between poor management, last minute force overtime, poor planning, no safety culture, and lack of concern for employees (vacation,pay)Slow paced and mostly uncooperative coworkersA typical day at work involved receiving samples shipped by customers or sales representative. Once samples were received and logged, various test were done by lab technicians for quality assurance. Management was pretty hands off. This had pros and cons. The upside is that there was no micromanaging. The downside is that issues that arose in the workplace weren't addressed.Often had celebrations to mark milestones in employee's lifeGeneral me-first attitude of the work cultureEnjoyed my jobI worked in the I.T. Department. I created training manuals and taught employees new software and software updates. I also wrote the company newsletter, which allowed me to get to know employees on a global level. I enjoyed the creativity as well as the ability to get to know many people.It was close to home.When I was injured, non work related, the H.R. Department made big mistakes which cost me a lot of money.Will not be Houghton much longer.It is a very siloed organization as well as very slow to advance internally as time goes on both technologically and with staff. It has recently been acquired by Quaker Chemical and a new company will be announced in 2018.caught in the middlewith the overall answers i feel caught in the middle, since pay was good, OT money was amazing, oh and benefits too, but the managment was at another counry and there was no safe place to preform, completly life hazard, not a proper laboratory.

But even more so it has great employees that you can really tell enjoy working for the company.3awfulthere is no room for advancement, you are not recognized for always being on time and never calling in when others call in twice a week and you pick up their slack. unskilled management who dont ask you questions they just thing they have it all figured out when they are the biggest problem on site. you might have to work here for 3-5 years before you get a raise. Cant think of anything good about working for this company, you can drive 30 minutes in either direction and get a $7 raise it is the lowest paying factory in this part of Iowa.You can make more at Mc Donalds.NoneEverything11Fun place to workLearned that night shift people are complete bad mofos. Also learned that if you work faster than the other people, you likely anger them slightly and its great. Learned to have a voice for myself and made some really awesome friends and you would more than likely have a beer with after shift regardless if its 7 am. worst part was the dramatic lady we didnt care for as a group. needless to say her work was harder because us, the shift before, made it harder on purpose.near everything.That ladyTons of work with little payoffTerrible work experience, between poor management, last minute force overtime, poor planning, no safety culture, and lack of concern for employees (vacation,pay)short breaks, low wage, terrible benifetsWe do the coolant reclycing at a local plant that is closingWe have a schedule to go through and maintain all machines in the plant when it was at full production, however there are always things that come up that we must take care of first, and these things have to be taken care of without stressing out because they are priority, of course this can change you entire plan for the day but as long as you are flexible you can make all things work. It is a friendly environment to work in with some really great gpeople that we come in contact with through out my position. I have enjoyed getting to learn new things all time and also getting to know not only the employees at my company but also the ones at the plant where we are in contract with. Everyday there is a something new however I love to learn and if you have a can do attitude you can learn and grow every day.Comfortable enviroment to work inThe plant closingGood place to workGreat people to work with in general. Not a lot of management structure. Was not always recognized for my efforts. Ok health benefits. Time-off was adequate.corporate office with mostly warm environmentDaily submissions sometimes rapid in succession required time management and going from task to task with no immediate supervision.Coordination of workflow departments required a sense of urgency usually.

Working at Anchor Bay for a temporary job still have me more experience then what I had.Ok placeOk place to work. Too many women in one room that envied one another. Was not a pleasant atmosphere. A lot of tension in the air especially caused by the main secretary. Did not want to do a good job for fear of being ridiculed by other ladies, therefore my job performance was not good here.Good locationAssistants expected to do much more work than job entailed, without any training.YayIt was ok I like it was good until I found a better job which I do like and I am very greatful at the time for teaching how to lift and build stuff so coolBad communication and your just a numberIt like highschool depending on what building you get sent to leaders act like 12 yr old calling you name and making fun of you I'm here to work for you not be the butt of the Joke for you.Ppl have guns while they work seen it a couple times made it idk not comfortable feeling being there in those buildingsHard to get a pay raiseDepending on your boss and how much you get done toy get a extra 5 mins on your breaksNot many fans for everyone bad communication between departmentsI loved it there. I had to quit because I didn’t have a ride anymore. I’m sadden and loved this job out of every job I ever worked at.Best job hands down! It’s easy work people there are nice and you get treated fairly there. I always minded my business but I absolutely loved it there. Cried because I had to leave.Breaks-bonus paid time off no holidays and no weekends.Longer breaks.Management does not careStarted on assembly but was quickly moved to forklift out of nesseccity. Didn't receive hilo pay until 5/6 months later. Force you to work long hours. Had worked there for over a year and there was no talk of raises. Told us we had to prove ourselves by working 60 hours weeks to receive a raise. Management is in the talks of getting an rfid system that will track employees movement.friendly co-workers, casual dresscode, good healthcaremanagement, Pay, Long work hoursWorse job everWorse job ever I had no schedule they basically will tell you in the last minute of your shift that you got to stay 2 or 4 more hours.Not safe place at all. No one cares about your safety. That give you below minimum wage and tons of hours. Don’t respect your privacy etc.Hi loGreat work place that I loved the employees was nice, the job had great benefits and payed great wages , I was a hard working person there , very dependable and also reliableNot horribleNot all employees are treated the same. They like to take advantage of newer employees. And working 12 hour shifts Monday-Friday and then 10 hours on Saturday, added up to great overtime, but never any time for family.This job is a rotating doorI seen people leave from this job all the time. Last time I was there we was on 12 hour shifts 6 days a week. The checks was nice but I was too tired to spend any money. I couldn't even spend time with my family because I was so tired. I quit after a month.I pick 4 starsIt was a great place to work at and the people there was nice and I work there before and I knew how things work at the job. I also love being around great people.Ok to work thereWas okay place to work just to far easy work just not enough people to work there so it was extra work to do so its was late hour and didnt have time for personal lifeCool place to workReally nice place to work I wish I didn't move so far because I really liked the place the people there manager was really good didn't have many issues with the jobGood pay good hoursFar outDon't work here unless your really fast paceI started my first day here September 18, 2018 at 8:30 am instead of 6:00am because of slow management and the supervisors didn't know that I was there because I was in the lunchroom for two hours smh. Long story short I was let go on my first day because I wasn't faster as the others in which was wrong because it was my first day how can you get rid of someone on the first day you could've at least waited until I finished the rest of the week out and if my performance was still not up to standards then let me go.
